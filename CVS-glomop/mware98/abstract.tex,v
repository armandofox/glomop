@After an inauspicious debut, communication-enabled personal digital
assistants (or PDA's) and handheld PC's are being ``rediscovered'' as
mobile information access terminals.  In response, developers have
attempted to bring complex applications such as Web browsers to such
devices.  However, the limited resources available on thin client platforms
make them unsuitable for hosting such applications.  In this paper, we
advocate moving application complexity from thin clients to an {\it
adaptive middleware proxy} (AMWP), an infrastructural application server
platform designed to support large populations and diverse applications.
We describe one such application, Top Gun Wingman, a graphical, split Web
browser for the Palm Pilot PDA that is currently in use by more than 11,000
users around the world.  Our discussion focuses on the design philosophy,
implementation, performance, and lessons learned from our experience with
the Wingman client and the middleware proxy that supports it.

@Many changes, related to the style the conference demands.  Much work on the bibliography will be necessary.

The recent surge in popularity of ``thin clients'' such as personal digital
assistants (PDAs) or smartphones has resulted in their users' desire to
treat them as mobile information access terminals.  In response, developers
have started attempting to bring complex applications such as web browsers
to this class of device.  However, the devices themselves are ill-suited to
complexity, having meager resources in comparison with desktop computers.
