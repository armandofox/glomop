@\section{CONCLUSIONS}
\label{concl}

This paper described the proxy-based architecture and implementation of Top
Gun Wingman, the
% world's
first graphical Web browser for the PalmPilot PDA.  We described our
middleware philosophy, which we refer to as the Adaptive Middleware Proxy
(AMWP) approach: let the client do only what it does well (client
competence), and push all other functions to a transparent infrastructure
proxy.  The proxy side of Wingman was described in terms of our TACC
(transformation, aggregation, customization, caching) programming model for
interactive Internet services, and discussed our experience with a
publicly-available cluster-based TACC server that has been operational
since late 1997 with virtually no unscheduled downtime.

Our experience with Wingman, as well as with the other TACC applications we
briefly described, supports our claims for the Adaptive Middleware Proxy
(AMWP) approach.  Wingman has better performance than a reduced client-only
port, has new features and behaviors (such as browsing software archives
and saving e-books, in the case of Wingman), and has the ability to almost
completely leverage the entire existing Web-based content and services
infrastructure.  Our proxy implementation has low administration cost (due
to our commodity-PC cluster design and graphical administration
interface)
that makes it realistic to operate services on a
$24\times 7$ basis for large user communities, and the ability to add
features at the proxy largely eliminates
the client software distribution problem
and preserves backward compatibility when client upgrades do occur.

In addition, our experience with a user community of over 11,000 suggests
that users will have no problem accepting middleware as a pervasive element
of Internet services.  For these reasons, and because Wingman
demonstrates key technologies needed to rapidly
deploy specialized information-delivery services for thin clients,
we believe that the principles
successfully demonstrated by Top Gun Wingman will play a prominent role in
the coming wave of applications for convergent thin client devices.

% don't forget to mention UI for refinement behavior.  Refs include
% pythia and the Hitachi paper that ripped us off in www-6.  
% Digestor (Bill Schilit et al) is a good ref for
% reformatting/repurposing content for small devices.

\subsection{Acknowledgments}

We extend our appreciation to the many students, staff, and faculty at UC
Berkeley who have helped us support our proxy cluster, debug our
applications, suggest feature enhancements, and act as reviewers for this
paper.  Special thanks go to Tim Kimball for all of his support efforts and
Paul Haeberli for allowing us to use his high quality graphics
transformation code.  Finally, we would like to thank the PalmPilot user
community for their tireless support and encouragement.

A large class of middleware-based applications for so-called ``convergent
devices'' (smart phones, smart pagers, wireless-enabled handheld PC's) will
involve specialized information delivery rather than browsing in the
desktop sense.  Although we chose to implement a ``horizontal'' application
(general Web browsing) because of its wide appeal, Wingman demonstrates the
fundamental pieces of technology needed to enable specialized information
delivery applications:

\begin{itemize}

\item Delivery of device-digestible rich text and graphics from
arbitrary source formats and origin servers, often with substantial
compression to address device memory and low-bandwidth constraints;

\item An ADU-based communication protocol that requires only unordered
datagram delivery, making it a good match for (e.g.) applications based
on paging networks;

\item Web-forms-style user interaction with either a Web-like or 
device-native UI and a back end consisting of an existing Internet
service;

\item The ability to deploy the above elements on a device-specific
basis (via user preferences) to large user communities in a
highly-available, incrementally scalable fashion.
