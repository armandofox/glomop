  We made it in to middleware.  Paper comments follow.  We have until the 5th 
  of June (roughly 3 weeks) to incorporate the changes.  I will assign people 
  to comments by early next week.

  This paper includes a nice description of a browser for handhelds 
  (PalmPilot), which is not particularly relevant to the conference 
  (although certainly interesting).  The relevant bit -- AMWP/TACC -- 
  is barely touched on, not motivated or explained in any detail 
  (though it certainly sounds interesting, and perhaps with examples 
  would be more valuable).

  Overall this is an excellent paper. It describes a practical 
  real-world example of middleware being applied without losing the 
  academic rigour so often sacrificed in such papers. 

  I have the following minor comments: 

  section 2, para 2: what is agressive about the computation ? 

  section 2.1: the abbreviation '24x7' is not well known enough to use 
  in an academic paper without explanation and saves nothing over words 
  such as 'continuous' or uninterruptable. 

  In sections 2.4 and 2.5 I would like to see some mention of the 
  impact of errors on the system. The test rig was obviously a low 
  error environment and it would be interesting to see the impact of 
  errors on existing systems and on Top Gun Wingman. Furthermore, is 
  the authors' approach more or less able to survive periods of 
  complete network disconnection, i.e. is it possible to receieve some 
  portion of a page, then to reconnect later (a few tens of seconds 
  perhaps) and receive the remiander (this pattern of interaction is 
  relativly commonplace among users of cellular telephones and). 

  As a more general comment I found the style used in the paper a 
  little arrogant and lacking in technical precision. More 
  specifically, there were times when words and phrases appeared to 
  have been used simply to make the sentence read better or the system 
  sounds more impressive without actually contributing anything to the 
  paper.

  Wingman is an interesting system, so I am glad to see an experience 
  paper on it.  This is a well-written paper.  However, I have two 
  concerns about it.  First, it is written in a style that tends to 
  overhype the contributions. Second, the lessons learned from this 
  work, which is the major contribution of the paper, are not very 
  surprising. 

  About the hype: Several times the paper says that Wingman is the 
  "world's first graphical web browser for the 3Com PalmPilot."  Why 
  does this statement belong in a technical paper?  In other words, 
  what is the technical significance of this?  There have been lots of 
  experimental and commercial web browsers written for hand-held 
  devices.  Some of the earliest systems I know of are Joel Bartlett's 
  W4 browser for the Apple Newton and the applications written for the 
  Xerox PARCTab.  Both of these used proxies, and neither are mentioned 
  in the paper.  I'd prefer it if the paper admitted up front that the 
  notion of using proxies to support low-functionality mobile devices 
  has been around for awhile.  I suggest putting the related work 
  section at the beginning of the paper and expanding it to include 
  more mention of previous work. 

  The paper makes a strong claim that "The AMWP approach results in 
  better performance".  Doesn't this depend on characteristics of the 
  network and platforms?  That is, can't you come up with 
  configurations for which the AMWP approach performs worse?  While 
  this statement is true for the performance numbers given in the 
  paper, one must be careful when claiming that it is universally true. 

  Having 11,000 users is really impressive!  How did you determine 
  this?  Are these folks who tried the system once or people who use it 
  daily? 

  About the lessons and experience section: This is in my opinion the 
  main contribution of the paper (since the TACC model has been 
  previously published).  In spite of the authors' claim of 
  "surprisingly powerful benefits", most of these lessons are fairly 
  obvious.  Were you really surprised by these?  It would be nice if 
  you could identify what things were truely surprising and what ones 
  you could have predicted in advance or learned from reading the 
  previous literature. 
  - ------------------------------

  Hi all, 

  We have until Friday, June 5th to revise our middleware paper.  I have been 
  a little behind the 8-ball in getting these revision assignments out - 
  please forgive me for that.  Below you will find specific tasks assigned to 
  you.  I would like you to complete your tasks and check in your changes no 
  later than Sunday afternoon (6pm), so that I can merge in the changes, 
  polish up the document, and get it to in-department reviewers on Monday, 
  get the reviews back by wednesday, and the camera ready in on Friday. 

  I've already modified the document to use the citation, bibliography, and 
  page formatting style that the conference enforces.  Please do a "cvs update 
  -d" in your mware98 CVS module, a "cvs update" of all.bib in the "GloMop" 
  module, and make sure you have a symlink from mware98/all.bib to 
  GloMop/all.bib. 

  At a high level, our tasks are: 
   - reduce 4 pages of content 
   - eliminate "arrogance" out of content 
   - flesh out related work, bring to beginning of paper 
   - motivate and expand detail of TACC/AMWP section, examples? 
   - solidify lessons and experience section 
   - fix bibliography (citenouns and entries) 
   - bios from authors 

  All of you owe me 1 paragraph (less than 100 words, please, the less the 
  better) bios of yourselves.  Please send those to me asap. Let me know if 
  you think anything else needs to change,  and let me know once you've 
  checked in your changes. 

  Here are your specific assignment: 

   Armando:  please go through the TACC/AMWP section (impl.tex) and expand 
             on the detail of TACC, possibly just by reintegrating the 
             example applications from the depricated proxy.tex file.  Give 
             yourself at most another 3/4-1 page of content for this.  Your 
             job is to satisfy the reviewer that complained about AMWP/TACC 
             barely being touched on.  At the very least, make it blindingly 
             obvious that more info on TACC can be found in our sosp16 paper. 
             Please also deal with reviewer #2's specific content comments - I 
             believe they all fall in the impl.tex section. 
             
    Ian:     please go through the related work section, and make sure it 
             covers content such as the Xerox PARCtab papers, the W4 browser 
             for the Apple Newton by Joel Bartlett, and anything else you 
             can find that is relevant.  Check the bibliography/related work 
             section of Barlett's paper as a good starting point.   The 
             related work section will be pulled from the end to the 
             beginning of the paper, so make sure it stands alone. 

   Anthony:  your job is pretty grungy.  Please go through the all.bib file 
             and fix up all of the bibliographic references in there so that 
             they actually appear in a sane way in our paper's bibliography. 
             Many references are missing dates, have semantically incorrect 
             things in the author field, etc.  Print out the paper and 
             fix all entries that don't look sane in the bibliography. 
             You will need to refer to bibtex (drop by 445 Soda and borrow 
             our LaTeX manual for this), as well as the "harvard" 
             bibliography style documentation (embedded as a tar archive 
             inside the following .tar.gz file: 

    http://www.comp.lancs.ac.uk/computing/middleware98/authors/latexstyles.tar 

             ).  Remember, all.bib is a file inside the GloMop/ CVS module, 
             and it must be linked to from the mware98 module.  Enlist 
             Dave's help if you need it. 

      Dave:  You get off scott-free, unless Anthony needs your help.  The 
             measurement section was not critized at all.  You and Anthony 
             did a good job on that. 

     Steve:  I will be reorganizing and strengthening the lessons and 
             experience section, cleaning up the formatting of many things 
             in the document to make it fit the new latex style sheet, and 
             once you've all checked in your work, trimming the fat out of 
             the paper to make the 16 page limit.  (The style sheet we must 
             use is far less dense than what we submitted, so we're up to 
             20 pages now).  I will also be taking out superfluous self- 
             aggrandizements, in order to get rid of the hype/arrogance that 
             2 of the 3 reviewers complained about.
