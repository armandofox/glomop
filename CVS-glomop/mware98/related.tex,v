@\section{RELATED AND FUTURE WORK}
\label{related}

Middleware services such as filtering and on-the-fly compression have
become particularly popular for HTTP \cite{HTTP_rfc}, whose proxy mechanism
was originally intended for users behind security firewalls. The mechanism
has been used to shield clients from the effects of poor (especially
wireless) networks \cite{pythia,mowgli_tr}, perform filtering
\cite{proxyfilter} and anonymization, and perform value-added
transformations on content, including Kanji transcoding \cite{delegate},
Kanji-to-GIF conversion \cite{ping}, application-level stream
transducers \cite{stream-transducers}, and personalized agent services for
Web browsing \cite{wbi}.  Infrastructure proxies have also been
used as a mechanism for application partitioning, as in the Wit project
\cite{wit,Wat94} which focuses on partitioning between the mobile and fixed
infrastructure.  The Video Gateway \cite{vgw} is an example of an
infrastructure proxy that performs application-level adaptation and serves
as a multicast to unicast protocol gateway.

Application design and implementation on PDA or smartphone class devices
has recently generated significant research effort.  In
\cite{uist97,pythia,hitachi-ripoff-paper}, the user interface
issues associated with introducing proxy controls as an orthogonal
extension to a Web browser interface are explored.  \cite{digestor}
describes an intelligent proxy that attempts to classify HTML pages into a
fixed number of bins, and performs semantic compression and layout
modification based on the chosen bin to repurpose the page for a PDA.

Our TACC middleware has actually been used to implement a variety of
distinct applications besides Wingman.  TranSend \cite{transend} is a Web
acceleration proxy that performs on-the-fly, datatype-specific compression,
in particular on GIF and JPEG images; it has been available to the public
since April 1997 and some of its main ideas have been instantiated
commercially as Intel QuickWeb.\footnote{There is no formal connection
between QuickWeb and TranSend.}  Top Gun Mediaboard is an electronic shared
whiteboard (a derivation of the desktop {\em mediaboard}
\cite{topgunmediaboard} application) for the PalmPilot, in which TACC
workers perform protocol adaptation as well as data transformation; it is
in prealpha use at UC Berkeley, and performs satisfactorily even over slow
links such as the Metricom Ricochet wireless packet radio modem
\cite{ricochet}.  Top Gun Mediaboard extends Wingman's markup and protocol
to accommodate the draw operations and user interactions required by a
shared whiteboard.

The commercial ProxiWeb  client \cite{proxiweb}
adds proxy-based implementations of features missing
from Wingman, including secure connections, cookies, and HTML forms.
Future research includes merging Top Gun Wingman and Top
Gun Mediaboard, resulting in a ``generic thin client'' application that
acts as the drawing, rendering, and interaction shell for proxied
applications such as MBONE access, Web access, or an environment-aware
interaction device \cite{hodes97}.  We will also further explore
the security and privacy implications of middleware in general (in
comparison to end-to-end security) and  Wingman 
in particular, attempting to apply some ideas from our earlier work on
security protocol adaptation for thin clients \cite{charon}.

%A large class of middleware-based applications for so-called ``convergent
%devices'' (smart phones, smart pagers, wireless-enabled handheld PC's) will
%involve specialized information delivery rather than browsing in the
%desktop sense.  Although we chose to implement a ``horizontal'' application
%(general Web browsing) because of its wide appeal, Wingman demonstrates the
%fundamental pieces of technology needed to enable specialized information
%delivery applications:

%\begin{itemize}

%\item Delivery of device-digestible rich text and graphics from
%arbitrary source formats and origin servers, often with substantial
%compression to address device memory and low-bandwidth constraints;

%\item An ADU-based communication protocol that requires only unordered
%datagram delivery, making it a good match for (e.g.) applications based
%on paging networks;

%\item Web-forms-style user interaction with either a Web-like or 
%device-native UI and a back end consisting of an existing Internet
%service;

%\item The ability to deploy the above elements on a device-specific
%basis (via user preferences) to large user communities in a
%highly-available, incrementally scalable fashion.

\subsection{Acknowledgments}

We extend our appreciation to the many students, staff, and faculty at UC
Berkeley that have helped us to support our proxy cluster, debug our
applications, suggest feature enhancements, and act as reviewers for this
paper.  Special thanks go to Tim Kimball for all of his support efforts and
Yatin Chawathe for his implementation of Top Gun Mediaboard.  We also would
like to thank Paul Haeberli for donating his high quality graphics
transformation code to our Top Gun Wingman implementation.  Finally, we
would like to thank the Palm Pilot user community for their tireless
support and encouragement.
