@Added proxy_stub directory
@
text
@This directory contains source code for the GloMop client-side application
support layers on different platforms.

   TK
   --
	This distribution uses the TK event loop in order to coordinate
        network packet arrivals and chunk delivery.  The core of the
        distribution is written in generic C, assuming the TK event
        loop structure.  Thin glue routines for TCL are available;
        similar glue for PERL/TK and straight C/TK will be developed
        in the future.

   proxy_stub
   ----------
	This directory contains a proxy stub that sits on a socket,
	waiting for connections, and respons to messages based on
	regular expressions.  The stub is (unfortunately) stateless.
