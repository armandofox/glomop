This directory contains the source code to the glomop Tk client
library and example applications.  The makefile has been spiffied
up to know about the nasty ginstall and lock source code control
system, so symlinks should automagically be built and torn down if
the correct code files are not in place.

To build the latest and greatest library and example apps, simply
type "make".  Three things of importance will be built:

   - libglomopTclTk.a
       This is the library that applications use to communicate with
       the glomop proxy.  It encapsulates all of the distillation and
       refinement control mechanisms, as well as the communications
       protocol used for talking with the proxy.

   - gmwish
       This is an environment that exports the libglomopTclTk.a
       functionality into the Tcl/Tk language environment.  An
       example image browser application has been built on top of
       it, as exists in the ../control_panel folder (the app itself
       is called image_browser.tcl).

   - test2
       This is an example C program that excercises the facilities of
       the libglomopTclTk.a environment.  It should be checked out as
       an example application - note the #include's that are
       necessary, and the style of function calls into the
       libglomopTclTk.a library.

Include files for applications are found in the master source
repository of this directory, which is currently:

   /staff/projects/WebProxyServer/glomop/glomop_client/TK

There are some dependencies currently hard-wired in the Makefile, to the
directories /pork/glomop/lib and /pork/glomop/includes, which contain
some Tcl, Tk, and DES libraries and includes, respectively.

In all cases, doing "make clean" is safe.

	This distribution uses the TK event loop in order to coordinate
        network packet arrivals and chunk delivery.  The core of the
        distribution is written in generic C, assuming the TK event
        loop structure.  Thin glue routines for TCL are available;
        similar glue for PERL/TK and straight C/TK will be developed
        in the future.

In order to use, run gmwish.ARCH, where ARCH is one of SunOS or HPUX,
depending on your architecture.  You will now have access to the Tcl
glomop interface.  If you want a pretty GUI, try running the
GloMop control panel.  To do this, source all of the .tcl files in
the control_panel subdirectory, and type:
   GM_CreateControlPanel .foo
