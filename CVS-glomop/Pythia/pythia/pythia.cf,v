# The file containing the actual code that does tag translation, HTML
#  distillation, and segmenting.  If not given, a default one is used.
#  You probably shouldn't modify this unless you know what you are

#  This section describes the user preferences that are maintained, and
#  a default value to use for each item when the user doesn't specify a
#  value.
#

# BUG::checkbutton options must have a default value of OFF, or the
# prefs dialog won't remember them. The reason is that unchecked
# checkboxes are not transmitted in the URL, so the main::register
# function doesn't see a value for them and thus uses their default
# value.  If the checkbox wasn't checked, we want the value to be OFF.
# This should really be fixed separately.

#  This section describes what filters are available and how to call
#  them. The format of each line is:
#
#   For a distillation server (pythsvc server listening on socket):
#  server|autoserver  <MIME type>  <perlfilename>  <pathname>
#   perlfilename: basename of the file that contains the decision
#        function, decide_distill, for this subtype.
#   pathname:  pathname of the program to start up as the server.  
#   'autoserver' will automatically start one instance of the server on
#  the same machine on which pythia is running.  'server' will not --
#  you'll have to start all instances manually.
#
#   For running an external pipeline:
#  pipeline <MIME type> <perlfilename> <opaque-args...>
#   Opaque-args is a list of whitespace-separated args that are passed
#  to the decision function as an array reference.  It's convenient for
#  one of these to be the pathname to the external binary, to avoid
#  hardwiring that information into the code.  '%a' in the pathname, if
#  present, is substituted with the architecture name of the proxy
#  machine, as returned by 'uname'.  '%b' expands to the bin directory.

bin  ../proxy_bin

# Distillers. Each line has the form:
# -how-      -MIMEtype-  -perlfile-  -binpath-  -other args-
pipeline     image/jpeg   jpeg       djpeg      %b/cjpeg
autoserver  image/gif    gif        gifmunch
#server       image/gif    gif        gifmunch
#pipeline     application/postscript  pstotext  pstotext_wrapper
