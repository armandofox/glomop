WHAT IS PYTHIA?

Pythia is an HTTP-compliant (mostly) proxy that was designed as a
testbed for experimenting with distillation and refinement as a means of
adapting to network and client variability.

You can build and run Pythia and go ooh and aah, but its main value will
probably be to let you experiment building your own proxied services on
top of it.

The code is cleaner and better documented in some places than others,
but it's free, and you get what you pay for.  :)  If you have serious
problems, send email and I'll try to help, but no promises---this code
is provided as is, etc.  See the LICENSE file for full details.

This code represents an early incarnation of various ideas developed
within the Daedalus and GloMop projects at UC Berkeley.  For more
information see http://daedalus.cs.berkeley.edu. 

WHAT YOU NEED TO HAVE INSTALLED

Requirements for running the basic Pythia with standalone external
image distillation using NetPBM:  
  
- Perl 5.002 or later installed, including the Socket and POSIX 
  modules (part of the standard distribution).  You can find the latest
  Perl at various FTP archives including ftp.uu.net,
  archive.cis.ohio-state.edu, jpl-devvax.jpl.nasa.gov; or on the Web,
  try http://www.metronet.com/perlinfo/source.

- The MD5 and LWP Perl modules:
	ftp://ftp.metronet.com/pub/perl/modules/by-module/MD5-*.tar.gz
	ftp://ftp.metronet.com/pub/perl/modules/by-module/lwp-*.tar.gz
  These must be installed as normal Perl modules 
  ("perl Makefile.PL ; make install" should do it for most people).

- The NetPBM header files and libraries.  These are needed for image
  distillation.
   You'll find the latest release of Netpbm at the following sites:
   * wuarchive.wustl.edu (128.252.135.4),
     directory /graphics/graphics/packages/NetPBM
   * ikaros.fysik4.kth.se (130.237.35.2), directory /pub/netpbm.
   * ftp.informatik.uni-oldenburg.de (134.106.1.9). This site also carries
     binaries for the Amiga.
   * peipa.essex.ac.uk (155.245.115.161), directory ipa/src/manip
   * ftp.rahul.net (192.160.13.1), directory /pub/davidsen/source
   * ftp.cs.ubc.ca, directory /ftp/archive/netpbm

- For inline JPEG distillation, you need cjpeg and djpeg.  These are available
  from the Independent JPEG Group.  If they're not present, everything
  will still work but you won't get JPEG distillation.

HOW TO INSTALL

1. In this directory, say `./configure'.
   ** NOTE 1 ** If your Perl include files (notably MD5 and LWP) are in
   ** a "nonstandard" place where Perl needs a -I<dir> switch to find them,
   ** you should give the option "--with-perlinc=<dir>" to configure.
   **
   ** NOTE 2 ** If your netpbm header files and libraries are in a 
   ** nonstandard place, i.e. if you normally would have to supply -I and
   ** -L flags to find them, you should give configure the command line
   ** option:  --with-netpbm=DIR  where DIR/include and DIR/lib contain
   ** the header and library files, respectively.  

2. Now say `gmake install'.  (Things are only installed at or below
   *this* level--nothing is put into /usr/local/bin, or anything like
   that.)  You need GNU Make to parse these Makefiles; note that 
   on some systems GNU Make is called `make', on others `gmake'.

3. To start: "gmake run PORT=portnum" where portnum is a TCP port of
  your choice on which Pythia will listen.  Pythia has many runtime
  options that you can set with the ARGS makefile variable; say "gmake
  run ARGS=-h" to see the possible options.

4. After pythia is running, you can start additional distillers
  (e.g. gifmunch) on other machines, by typing:
  
        cd ../proxy_bin
        gifmunch.<arch> <listenport> <pythia-host> <pythia-port>
  
   The proxy_bin directory is created by 'make install'.  <arch> should
   be the generic OS name on your machine as returned by 'uname'.  (Look
   at the filenames in the proxy_bin directory and you'll get the idea.)
   <listenport> should be a random port number on the machine on which
      gifmunch will run; it will listen for requests on this port.
   <pythia-host> is the machine on which pythia is running, and
   <pythia-port> is the port on which pythia is listening (the one you
       specify on the pythia command line).

5. The documentation (a set of man pages, in the man/ subdirectory)
   should get made as part of the 'make install'.  (If not, 'make man'
   at the top level to get them.)  The man pages are generated from Pod
   embedded in the .pl files, so you can easily generate HTML, LaTeX,
   etc. documentation from the same sources.

TO USE PYTHIA:

Set your HTTP proxy to point to the correct machine and port.  Go to
the URL  "http://PythiaLogin" to start a session.  Use the URL
"http://PythiaPrefs" to change your prefs (you should probably
bookmark these two "magic" URLs).
