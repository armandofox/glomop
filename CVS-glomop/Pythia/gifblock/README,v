This Makefile creates the 'gifblock' program, which extracts an
arbitrary subregion from a GIF and writes it out as another GIF.

It links against the ppm libraries and uses munged versions of ppm sources.

Usage of the program: gifblock x0 y0 x1 y1 c <in.gif >out.gif

(x0,y0): upper left corner of subregion
(x1,y1): lower right corner
c: number of colors to quantize to; negative means grayscale

if (x1,y1)==(-1,-1), the whole image is returned (i.e. program acts as
the "identity filter").
