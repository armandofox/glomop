         Poisson processes with fixed hourly rates, but that other
         connection arrivals deviate considerably from Poisson; that

		  A log-structured file system writes all

		  crash recovery.  The log is the only structure on
		  disk;  it contains indexing information so that
		  files can be read back from the log efficiently.  In
		  order to maintain large free areas on disk for fast
		  writing, we divide the log into segments and use a
		  segment cleaner to compress the live information
		  from heavily fragmented segments.  We present a
		  series of simulations that demonstrate the
		  efficiency of a simple cleaning policy based on cost
		  and benefit.  We have implemented a prototype
		  log-structured file system called Sprite LFS;  it
		  outperforms current Unix file systems by an order of
		  magnitude for small-file writes while matching or
		  exceeding Unix performance for reads and large
		  writes.  Even when the overhead for cleaning is
		  included, Sprite LFS can use 70% of the disk
		  bandwidth for writing, whereas Unix file systems
		  typically can use only 5-10%.} }
