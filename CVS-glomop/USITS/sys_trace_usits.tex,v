% TEMPLATE for Usenix papers, specifically to meet requirements of
%  TCL97 committee.
% originally a template for producing IEEE-format articles using LaTeX.
%   written by Matthew Ward, CS Department, Worcester Polytechnic Institute.
% adapted by David Beazley for his excellent SWIG paper in Proceedings,
%   Tcl 96
% turned into a smartass generic template by De Clarke, with thanks to
%   both the above pioneers
% use at your own risk.  Complaints to /dev/null.
% make it two column with no page numbering, default is 10 point

% Munged by Fred Douglis <douglis@@research.att.com> 10/97 to separate
% the .sty file from the LaTeX source template, so that people can
% more easily include the .sty file into an existing document.  Also
% changed to more closely follow the style guidelines as represented
% by the Word sample file. 
% This version uses the latex2e styles, not the very ancient 2.09 stuff.

\subsection*{Abstract}
% nuked italics -- FD
In this paper, we present the analysis of a large client-side web trace
gathered from the Home IP service at the University of California at
Berkeley.  Specifically, we demonstrate the heterogeneity of web clients,
the existence of a strong and very predictable diurnal cycle in the
clients' web activity, the burstiness of clients' requests at small time
scales (but not large time scales, implying a lack of self-similarity), the
presence of locality of reference in the clients' requests that is a strong
function of the client population size, and the high latency that services
encounter when delivering data to clients, implying that services will need
to maintain a very large number of simultaneously active requests.  We then
present system design issues for Internet middleware services that were
drawn both from our trace analysis and our implementation experience of the
TranSend transformation proxy.
