"3">The Problem: Multimedia, Mobile Computing, and Networks</H2>
Mobile computing devices are much less useful if they don't give you connectivity
to email, the WWW, the corporate Lotus Notes server, etc. However, it is
well known that wireline analog modems and wide-area wireless services such
as ARDIS and cellular modems are limited to kilobits-per-second bandwidth,
which is painful for Web surfing and multimedia document retrieval and barely
adequate for &quot;disconnected&quot; applications such as email.  No substantial
increases in wide-area wireless bandwidth -- which is key for mobile users
-- are on the horizon.<BR>
<BR>
On the other hand, desktop CPU power is becoming cheaper every day, and
desktop bandwidth is already much better than wireless bandwidth and is
continuing to increase.  <BR>

<H2>Computing By Proxy: Trading Cycles for Bandwidth</H2>
A powerful, well-connected desktop workstation can run a process that acts
as a <B><I>proxy</I></B> for a mobile client on the other side of a low-bandwidth
connection. The proxy's job is to retrieve documents on the client's behalf,
and transmit them to the client across the slow link in a <I>format that
is useful to the client and can be transmitted quickly on the slow link</I>.
For example, a large color GIF might be transcoded to a thumbnail-sized
gray scale image for display on a PDA, along with a button that causes the
original to be retrieved and displayed. This process of <I>distillation</I>
can be applied to other datatypes as well; for example, PostScript can be
distilled to plain ASCII text, and video can be distilled by decreasing
the image size, color depth, and/or frame rate. We have working prototypes
of all three of these examples. <BR>
<BR>
<IMG SRC="key.gif" WIDTH="32" HEIGHT="24" ALIGN=bottom NATURALSIZEFLAG=
"3"><I>Because cycles are cheap and plentiful, the proxy can transcode on
the fly.  The content and administration at the server need not be changed,
which is important given the large and diverse population of existing servers.</I><BR>
<BR>
The proxy can base its transcoding decisions on the dynamically-changing
network characteristics of the proxy-to-client link. As bandwidth, latency
and network usage cost fluctuate, the aggressiveness of distillation and
the policy decisions for downloading can adapt.  Because the network is
continuously monitored and transcoding decisions are made dynamically and
just-in-time, the adaptation can be very fine-grained.  The GloMop API hides
most of these policy changes from applications. <BR>
<BR>
<IMG SRC="key.gif" WIDTH="32" HEIGHT="24" ALIGN=bottom NATURALSIZEFLAG=
"3"><I>GloMop-aware applications deal only with the logical structure of
documents, and don't have to be made aware of every change in network state.</I>

<H2>Successive Refinement</H2>
A distilled representation of a document contains sufficient semantic content
for the user to identify whether the document is valuable enough to request
one of several kinds of <I>refinement</I>. For example, in the ASCII distilled
version of a PostScript document, the user could request the transmission
of embedded images from a distilled PostScript document, or the user might
like to zoom in on a portion of a map to see detail for a small geographic
area of interest. <BR>
<BR>
<IMG SRC="key.gif" WIDTH="32" HEIGHT="24" ALIGN=bottom NATURALSIZEFLAG=
"3"><I>Where bandwidth is scarce, successive refinement allows the user
to decide exactly which portions of which documents she wants to pay the
full price (time or money) to download in original form.</I> <HR><!-------------------------------------------------------------------><A HREF="index.html"><IMG SRC=
