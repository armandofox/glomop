<h1>Stuff that may not make it into SOSP paper</h1>

These may get into Steve's cache paper, or some other future paper....

<ul>
     <li> when do you throw stuff out of the cache?
     <li> what do you throw out (small vs. big, original vs. distilled,
	  old vs. new)
     <li> when do you recompute new distillation level vs. using one
	  that is close enough?
     <li> can you distill from an already distilled representation to save
	  time?
     <li> distillation cost largely irrelevant - cache miss time is the
	  most important cost in the system (not computation, not local
	  communication)
     <li> can we keep metadata on whether a server is fast or slow (to aid
	  with eviction decisions and predict end-to-end latency to client)?
     <li> what's the space of possible caching policies?
     <li> economic analysis to prove our model of internet service is cost
	  effective.
     <li> how do we deal with timeouts (harvest, front-end, ...)
</ul>
