<title>DCNS Meeting</title>

<body>
<H2>DCNS Meeting</H2>
<H3>September 10th, 1996</H3>
<P>
<B>Present at meeting:</B>
<a href="http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~gribble">Steve Gribble</a>,
<a href="http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~fox">Armando Fox</a>,
<a href="http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~yatin">Yatin Chawathe</a>,
<a href="http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~brewer">Eric Brewer</a>,
<a href="mailto:cliff@@ack.berkeley.edu"><i>Cliff Frost</i></a>,
<a href="mailto:lutz@@cs.berkeley.edu"><i>Ken Lutz</i></a>,
plus a few more DCNS people whose names I didn't get.

<hr>

<i>We presented an overview of what a proxy is, how it works, and why
HIP users would want to use one.  We then presented our wish list, a
rough outline of a path to going live, and raised issues of what happens
if the proxy service is successful.</i>

<H3>Wish List</H3>

<OL>
     <LI> <B>PR Campaign</B>:  DCNS is happy to help with this.  They
	  seemed pleased with the notion that this can be considered a
	  trial of a new paradigm for running ISPs, and the media attention
	  that this could cause.
	  <P>
	  The Workstation Support people should get involved soon, both to
	  help advertise, and to discuss the possibilty of inclusion with
	  the Berkeley Internet Kit (BIK).  BIK inclusion would only happen
	  after the proxy has proven itself to be successful.

     <LI> <B>Trace Collection</B>:  DCNS happy to help, but only after
	  privacy issues have been satisfactorily solved, and the
	  responsibility for maintaining privacy is shifted (legally?) from
	  DCNS to us.  Mentioned possibility of putting tracer in the DMZ,
	  or using Vern Paxson's traces as Venkat is doing, but this would
	  not get local hits, and would not let us look inside packets to
	  gather URLs and response headers.
	  <P>
	  Modem banks all on one 10Mb/s Ethernet, soon to be put on
	  switched Ethernet.  We want to trace before that happens.  We
	  will use one of our P200's to do the tracing.
	  
</OL>

<H3>Going Live</H3>

<UL>
     <LI> <B>Issues for us</B>:
	  <UL>
	       <LI> allocating machines in NOW (Ken Lutz will
		    help with this, suggesting reusing the Inktomi machines
		    and net).
	       <LI> make sure we have a clear network path from DNCS to
		    NOW, and we won't hose the department Ethernet.
	  </UL>
     <LI> <B> Issues for DCNS</B>:
	  <UL>
	       <LI> BIK - inclusion only if trial successful.
	       <LI> If successful, how long will we (CS) run the proxy?
		    <i>About a year.</i>  What happens after that year?
		    <i>Need to figure out a migration path.  Obsolete NOW
		    machines suggested.</i>
