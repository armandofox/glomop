<h1>Almaden Grand Central Station project</h1>

Please keep confidential.

<ul>
  <li> Handheld devices as "push receivers"; hotsync as (one possible)
       comm channel
  <li> Gatherer/collector architecture creates various "channels" of
       data (a cross between Marimba and TranSend architecture, but no
       emphasis on scalability, etc.)
  <li> Want to transcode  channel data to push it into "native" Pilot
       db's, apps (e.g. put movie showtimes into your calendar DB)
  <li> <b>Use existing data in Pilot db's as your user profile!</b>
</ul>

<h1>What they want...</h1>

<ul>
  <li> Use proxy transcoding techniques in "gateway" that hangs off
       desktop client and transcodes for Pilot
  <li> My suggestion: ditch desktop client, run the proxy as part of the
       central gatherer/collector infrastructure and have handhelds
       connect directly (phone or hotsync)
  <li> 
</ul>

<h1>What we can do...</h1>

<ul>
  <li> WingMan should allow a "local cache" which is a database
  <li> Export the format of this database so other apps can put stuff
       in; WingMan becomes generic graphical browser (not just Web)
</ul>
