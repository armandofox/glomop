<h1><center>Geoworks/Wink Discussion with Eric, 6/4
</center></h1>

Geoworks posn:
<ul>
  <li> Want to make summer milestone; OK
  <li> Want semi-exclusive license: NO
  <li> Will do it themselves if we don't go along: if they want, I doubt
       it
  <li> Not a 100% clear vision of what the "product" would be
</ul>

Wink posn:
<ul>
  <li> More flexible but don't want to be scrod for it
  <li> Want ongoing discussions, "idea work", perhaps part-time/consult
       basis; lure of options for privately-held co.
  <li> Better idea of what product would be, willing to work w/us to add
       the "right" features to ICAP
  <li> Want progress "soon" but no indication that end of summer is a
       hard deadline
  <li> We'd like to work w/them
  <li> Better match to our research milestones; Geoworks wants a web
       proxy, Wink wants bona fide client-aware translation
</ul>

Issues as I see them
<ul>
  <li> Geoworks: what part of code would they own vs. Berkeley owns;
       this is the big one
  <li> One-time license: is this a wise arranement for us
  <li> Want to work w/Wink, maintain some level of formal contact over summer
  <li> Where/who  would we work with at Geowks??
</ul>

What we can realistically deliver Geoworks/TCS
<ul>
  <li> Scalable--this is the only "rocket science" part
  <li> No HTML chunking! but HTML renderer will make the display
       decisions
  <li> HTML-form distillation interface, or similar
  <li> Distillation such as we do now, but more connection-aware
  <li> Translate unsupported HTML (tables, frames, scripts), and correct
       "bad" HTML for less-flexible browser
  <li> A variety of other options Steve and I came up with
</ul>

Other issues
<ul>
  <li> Motorola will sign "generic" Pythia license "soon"
  <li> Will contact Perlman (PacBell Inet rep)
  <li> Berkeley TCS (Jack McCreedey); relationship of Geoworks project?
</ul>
