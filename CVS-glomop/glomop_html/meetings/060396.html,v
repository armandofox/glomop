<title>GloMop: Week of 6/3</title>
</head>
<body>

<h2>Progress</h2>
<ul>
  <li> ASPLOS-7 paper accepted, woohoo! But lots of work to be done.
  <li> Wink seems like they're starting HTML-to-ICAP internally, we
       should get rolling and get them on the right track; they want to
       know what we're doing re: HTML segmentation.
  <li> Modular proxy: fetching of document and identification of
       high-level type is working.  Work continues on stateful chunking.
  <li> GloMop protocol:
       <ul>
         <li> Chunk and DTOC formats determined.  Decision
              that chunk compression/e2e encryption should be done at app level
              so chunks can remain self-describing and don't need to be
              decompressed to decode the header info.
         <li> Metadata will be per-document, not per-chunk, and will
              encode such things as simple layout info (e.g. aspect
              ratio for images, simple "maximal horizontal strips"
              layout for rich text, etc.)
       </ul>
  <li> GloMop client:
       "Mac control panels" style UI in place, can connect and
       authenticate, filehandle callbacks work in Tk.
  <li> Research question: clearly we need "GloMop Lite" for smaller
       devices (we have yet to figure out what exactly this is,
       i.e. what features to take out of GloMop).  But for laptops,
       should we be spending effort on "full GloMop" or on Evil Twins?
       Or are the latter really a superset of the former?  Brainstorming
       continues...
</ul>

<hr><h2>Critical path</h2>

<ul>
  <li> Threaded I/O abstraction: try to subclass LWP::UserAgent to add
       asynchronous methods to it
  <li> Stateful chunking: interface for the Segmentation Manager
  <li> Refinement/prefs (UI on client side, specification on proxy side)
</ul>

<hr><h2>Short term plans</h2>

<ul>
  <li> Finish brainstorming about the role of evil twins vs. full GloMop
  <li> Define GloMop Lite and move forward with ICAP extension
</ul>
