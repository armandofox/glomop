This page lists the current projects we are working on and who are the primary
people for each. AF=Armando Fox, SG=Steve Gribble, DG=Dave Gourley. 
<H2>Project List</H2>

<H2><A NAME="anchor85855"></A>Mobile WWW Browser</H2>
<DL>
<DT><B>General:
<DD></B>We still need a richtext language for feeding to PDA's, and code
that generates output in that language from HTML.  Recent attempts at this
appear to have been stillborn; Kim Liu's HTML parser is not useful (the
Perl parser is actually more robust).  We need to get a concrete implementation
plan for this ASAP.
<DT><B>For Newton:
<DD></B>Still trying to get code from Univ. Karlsruhe for Newton client,
which is pretty spiffy.  Maybe we should instead try to get Joel Bartlett's
code from his W4 project?
<DT><B>For MagicLink:
<DD></B>Talked to Peter Doemel at WWW-5; he used to be a Magic Cap developer,
is now at Univ. Frankfurt.  He worked with some guys who had implemented
a browser for MagicLink, and will put in a good word for us to try to get
the source.
<DT><B>For Geos:
<DD></B>Is there a GeoWorks 2.x WWW browser, and if not, can we get a GeoWorks
3.x product?
</DL>
<H2><HR><BR>
<A NAME="anchor87091"></A>Real Email</H2>
I'd like to do something about this, even if it's not MIME.  My cannot-live-without
feature list includes:
<UL>
<LI>Table-of-contents fetching
<LI>Arbitrary filtering at proxy, including some default behaviors for PDA's:
no PostScript, no Java applets, nothing encoded in base64, etc.  We should
investigate how much, if anything, IMAP4 will buy us.
<LI>Future feature: Having the proxy authenticate your outgoing mail somehow.
 The strongest thing it can say (via Charon) would be something like: &quot;This
mail was sent by someone who knows a particular session key, and therefore
knows Foo's Kerberos password with high probability&quot;
