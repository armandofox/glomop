<title>GloMop Summer Progress</title>

<h2>5/29</h2>

<ul>
  <li> Experiments seem to show that the gm_sock abstraction can sustain
       between 600KB/s and 1MB/s on the same ethernet between solaris
       2.5 boxen, lower on HPUXen.  This is probably fast enough for the
       time being.  Looks like we may eventually have to move to C after
       all.
  <li> For web proxy: we can push all remote control to distillers.
       Pass client socket FH if distiller is on same machine
       (optimization), or give client a redirect while contacting remote
       distiller.  How can we play a similar trick with the modular
       proxy?
  <li> Chris Jones has made progress on a threaded Perl....
  <li> What should the "generic stateful segmentation" serivces module
       look like?  It needs to provide chunk storage, mapping URN's to
       stored chunks, and client retrieval of chunks.
  <li> Should the chunks
       be stored in some intermediate form?  Or opaquely in a specific
       form?  I.e. when we chunk up HTML, do we store the chunks as
       HTML, as ICAP, or as some other form?
  <li> Is it worth heavily modularizing the existing Web proxy?  or just
       cleaning it up and licensing it "as is"?
</UL>

<b>Critical path for modular proxy:</b>

<ul>
  <li> Threaded I/O abstraction: try to subclass LWP::UserAgent to add
       asynchronous methods to it
  <li> Stateful chunking: interface for the Segmentation Manager
</ul>
