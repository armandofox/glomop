<p>The explosive growth of the Internet and the proliferation of smart
cellular phones and handheld wireless devices is widening an already large
gap between Internet clients. Clients vary in their hardware resources,
software sophistication, and quality of connectivity, yet server support
for client variation ranges from relatively poor to none at all. In this
paper we introduce some design principles that we believe are fundamental
to providing “meaningful” Internet access for the entire range of clients.
In particular, we show how to perform on-demand datatype-specific lossy
compression on semantically typed data, tailoring content to the specific
constraints of the client. We instantiate our design principles in a proxy
architecture that further exploits typed data to enable application-level
management of scarce network resources. Our proxy architecture generalizes
previous work addressing all three aspects of client variation by applying
well-understood techniques in a novel way, resulting in quantitatively
better end-to-end performance, higher quality display output, and new capabilities
for low-end clients. </p>

<p>Even as mobile computing and network computing are gaining momentum,
Internet security is sharing the spotlight. Security and authentication
on open networks is difficult even without the additional risks posed by
wireless media. At the same time, the hardware and software constraints
imposed by “small” mobile devices such as PDA’s and smart phones are leading
to the pervasive use of application-level proxies to mediate between clients
and servers. To date, less attention has been focused specifically on securing
the connection between the client and an application-level proxy, independently
of any particular service. We describe how to provide secure access to
application-level proxied services using an indirect protocol called Charon,
which leverages the strong protocol and deployed infrastructure of Kerberos
IV. Charon partitions the Kerberos client functionality into a very simple
client module that does little more than DES encryption, and a Unix-hosted
unprivileged proxy module that runs the remainder of the Kerberos client
protocol and can interoperate with other proxy code that provides application-level
proxy services. The client module is extremely lightweight and amenable
to implementation even on the most modest PDA-class devices. The proxy
is trusted as much as any other Kerberized service, but it never learns
the user’s Kerberos password or ticket-granting service session key. As
a result of this partitioning, clients can continue to enjoy the benefits
of proxy-mediated access in a secure way, in addition to gaining secure
access to and interoperability with existing Kerberized services.</p>
