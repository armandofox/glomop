<h1>GloMop Backgrounder</h1>

This page contains links to useful stuff you should read if you're
planning to work with our group.  Depending on which specific areas of
the project you're working on, one of the other group members will tell
you which ones are most important.

<h2>Administrivia Checklist</h2>

<ul>
  <li> Have you met with Terry Lessard-Smith, our admin (643 Soda, 2-5399), to
       get your timecards, payroll, etc. set up?
  <li> Have you gotten a "CS named account"?  (Email Eric Fraser, <a
       href="mailto:fraser@@cs.berkeley.edu">fraser@@cs.berkeley.edu</a>,
       to get this set up)
  <li> Have you gotten a Kerberos password?  (See the file <a
       href="file:/usr/sww/doc/kerberos/quick-start">/usr/sww/doc/kerberos/quick-start</a> for instructions)
  <li> Have you gotten necessary keys/cardkeys?  (Email Anne Fuller, <a
       href="mailto:fuller@@cs.berkeley.edu">fuller@@cs.berkeley.edu</a>,
       or for cardkeys only, fill out the <a
       href="http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/Forms/soda.keyreq.html">online form</a>)
</ul>

<h2>Background Reading</h2>

<ul>
  <li> <a href="http://www5conf.inria.fr/fich_html/papers/P48/Overview.html">
       <B>Reducing WWW Latency and Bandwidth Requirements via Real-Time
       Distillation</b></a>, presented at WWW-5.  Basic concepts behind
       TranSend and our proxy architecture, as embodied in an early
       prototype.  (Also <a
       href="http://www5conf.inria.fr/fich_html/slides/papers/PS16/P48/overview.htm">slides</a> from conference talk)
  <li> <B>Scalable Network Services.</b>  Detailed description of the
       scalable architecture behind TranSend.  A more complex read than
       the WWW-5 paper, but necessary background.
  <li> <b>The Case For TACC.</b>  Armando's quals proposal; a lot of
       overlap with the <i>Scalable Network Services</i> paper, but
       contains the "vision" of where the architecture can go.
       <a href="/~fox/papers/Quals.ps.gz">Compressed Postscript</a>,
       <a href="/~fox/papers/Quals.pdf">PDF</a>
  <li> <b>Orthogonal Extensions to the WWW User Interface
       Using Client-Side Technologies</b>.  Our UIST demo that talks
       about user interface issues for web/proxy services.  The
       accompanying videotape isn't here though.  <a
       href="/~fox/papers/UIST.ps.gz">Compressed Postscript</a>
</ul>

<h2>Tools To Know and Love</h2>

Extensive online documentation for most of these is available; see the
"Tools Doc" section of <a href="/~fox/bookmarks.html">bookmarks
list</a>.  <i>Info available</i> means that Emacs has info listings
installed for the tool; type <tt>M-x info</tt> in Emacs to get it.

<ul>
  <li> <B>CVS</b>, the Concurrent Versions System.
       <i>De rigeur</i>--if you don't know it, learn it now.  We use it
       religiously for revision control.  Here's a <a
       href="/~fox/cvs.html">quick start/cheat sheet</a>.  Also see the
       <a href="http://www.loria.fr/~molli/cvs/doc/cvs_toc.html">full
       online manual</a>.
       <ul>
         <li> To use the CVS repository for the GloMop project, do the
              following two things before issuing CVS commands:<br>
              <tt>setenv CVSROOT full-sail:/home/CVS</tt><br>
              <tt>setenv CVS_RSH ssh</tt><br>
         <li> If Kerberos works for you, you should instead set CVS_RSH
              to whatever the Kerberized <i>rsh</i> is, and be sure you
              have a valid ticket before using CVS commands.
       </ul>
  <li> <b>Kerberos</b>, which we use not only for interactive logins but
       also for client-server CVS transactions.  If you're reading this
       on a machine that mounts SWW, see the file <a
       href="file:/usr/sww/doc/kerberos/quick-start">/usr/sww/doc/kerberos/quick-start</a> for an intro.
  <li> <B>Perl 5</b>, the mother-of-all-scripting-languages.   <i>Info
       available</i>.
  <li> <b><a
       href="http://http.cs.berkeley.edu/~bmiller/FAQ.html">Research
       Administration FAQ.</a></b>.  Reimbursements, payroll,
       copycards...it's all here.
</ul>
