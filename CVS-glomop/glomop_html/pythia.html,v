<title>Pythia HTTP Proxy</title>

<h1>What Does It Do?</h1></a>

Currently Pythia performs two types of distillation for you:

<ul>
  <li> Inlined images are distilled  by reducing their dimensions and
       quantizing the colors to a smaller colormap.  Typical size
       reduction is about two base-10 orders of magnitude.
  <li> PostScript files are converted to HTML-formatted text.  Some
       PostScript files cannot be converted, but things like technical
       reports usually convert pretty well.  Size reduction varies, but
       a factor of 5 to 10 is not unusual.  Figures are currently not
       converted. 
</ul>

Next to each distilled object will be a link that looks like this
<strong>&#164;</strong>, which you can follow to retrieve the original
(undistilled) object.

<h1>How to Register</h1></a>

<ul>
  <li>In your Web browser preferences, set your HTTP proxy to
       <b>espresso.cs.berkeley.edu</b> on port <b>5555</b>.
  <li>Click the Reload button and you'll get a Registration form to fill
       out.
  <li> Submit the form and surf away.
</ul>

<p>Some interesting pages with lots of embedded graphics:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="/~fox/fulton">Fulton St. Home Page</a>
  <li><a href="/~ddgarcia/photos.html">Dan "Spam" Garcia's Photo
       Gallery</a>
  <li> <a href="/~brewer/papers.html">Eric Brewer's publications (pstotext
       demo)</a>
</ul>

<p>
When you want to go back to normal surfing, go back to your browser preferences
and disable the HTTP proxy (i.e. set it to nothing).  You may also have
to flush your browser's disk and/or memory caches if you visit pages
that were previously visited for you by the proxy.
</p>

<p>
If you're interested in how the demo is implemented,

<h1>Pythia Q&A</h1></a>

<ul>
<li><b>
    Sometimes the thumbnail drawing isn't very useful.
    </b>
    <ul><li>
         Currently the only thresholding is based on the image size in bytes.
         We're 
         working on doing some kind of thresholding based on entropy or
         colormap information,
         to estimate how useful a distilled version would be to a human.
  </ul>

<li><b>
    How do you generate the thumbnail images?
    </b>
    <ul><li>
         We use the (very good) freeware PBM/PPM/PGM tools, by Jef Poskanzer,
         David Koblas et al., held together with duct tape and some
         homemade glue code.
    </ul>

<li><b>
    Are you caching any documents/graphics?
    </b>
    <ul><li>
    None at all at the proxy, though your browser may do some caching if
    you visit a page more than once.  Our whole point is to show that 
         it is computationally feasible to do distillation in real time.
         (For a 14.4K modem, the communication time still dominates.)
         However, we may add caching of things like the Dilbert page,
         as well as some prefetching.
    </ul>

<li><b> 
     This is cool!  I'd like to give you and your advisor new equipment
     or large sums of money so you can continue to work on this research!
    </b>
     <ul><li>Great! Why don't you <a
          href="mailto:brewer@@cs.berkeley.edu">send Eric some email</a>, he
          will be overjoyed to hear it.  Also, check out <a
          href="index.html">GloMop's other research projects.</a>

<a name=diff>
<h1>Pythia vs. "Real" GloMop</h1>
    
Although Pythia demonstrates our ideas using off-the-shelf Web browsers
and servers, it differs from a "real" GloMop-aware browser in several
ways:

<ul>
  <LI><b>Protocol negotiation:</b> We used a <A
       HREF="demoxplain.html#hack">hack</A> based on
       munging HTTP addresses to implement the "protocol" by which
       distillation and refinement requests are passed to the
       proxy, to circumvent the statelessness of HTTP.  A real GloMop
       client accomplishes this using the
       bona fide layered protocol we have designed.

  <li><b>Sizes and color depths of distilled images:</b>
       A real GloMop client will negotiate a representation with the
       proxy, based on the measured quality of your network connection.
       The quality will change dynamically as the network bandwidth and
       latency changes.

  <li> <b>Proxy host:</b> Although Pythia is scalable in that the
       distillation is farmed out to various Unix workstations here at
       Berkeley using Unix IPC, the real GloMop proxy will exploit the
       a <i>ATM network of workstations</i> run by the
       <a href="http://now.cs.berkeley.edu">Berkeley NOW</a> project.
</ul>
