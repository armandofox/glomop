@-  Gracefully handle FunDecls and FunDefs for functions (like strcpy(), etc.)
   that we interpret internally.
-  Add distinction between "possible" and "probable/definite" buffer overflow.
-  Add support for the `min' operation.
-  Improve the constraint-sig interface: instead of having stuff like queryGe,
   just let the caller register a callback for the terms it is interested in,
   and call the callback with the value of the term when it is known.
-  Better cycle analysis: get some useful information out of _every_ cycle.
   (But how to remove cycles so you don't see them again, after process them?)
-  Represent Str's with a region in 2-space (not necessarily a rectangle).
-  Add structure fields.
-  Add points-to analysis.
-  Deal with 'char p[10+sizeof(q)];' or 'int x; char p[10+x];' gracefully.
