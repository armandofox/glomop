@- identify nokia browser by "user-agent" field
- "PythiaPromo" string takes up too much space (can omit if nokia)
- imagemaps are busted on browser; work around? construct client side
map?
- multiple levels of refinement?
- fetching a GIF standalone: should use the refinement mech., even
though currently it bypasses it by design.

Do forms work? If not, how to set preferences? (HACK: file in your home
  dir)


Known Pythia Bugs

1.  POST FORMS DON'T WORK because "POST" method is messed up
2.  Set-Cookie is not handled properly for "304 Not Modified" response
3.  Sometimes locks up and needs to be restarted.  Rumors of a slow leak
in Perl?
4. Children don't always die when proxy killed
5. DNS problem with gethostbyname
6. errors in connect aren't trapped and cause "can't call writesock in
   empty package 'blah'"
7. reaping of distillers doesn't work
8. "Force b&w" option in prefs isn't honored if image is below
distillation size thresh

Other bugs etc from Steve

Bug fixes needed
----------------
  o  reload "if-not-modified-since" getting dropped on the floor.  (turning
     cache off as band-aid).
  o  imagemap gets stripped off (eg. http://Cobweb.Berkeley.EDU/ )


Possible augmentations/changes to proxy
---------------------------------------

  o - "Beginner's" refinement dial - the only choices you allow the user are
     to specify their monitor bit depth and to select from "extreme,
     moderate, light, and none" levels of distillation.  This is the
     idea of picking out 4 suitable points in the N-d refinement
     space.  Alternatively, the user hits..
  
    - "advanced" and explicitly chooses all N-dimensions.

  o  Give option of using "LOWSRC" to first transmit all images distilled,
     and then automatically replace with higher resolution undistilled
     images.

  o  Re-registration problem

  o  In "Registration succeeded" page, need link to page user was originally
     trying to load.

- *REALLY* need caching of images, at least till user leaves the page.
(Heuristic: when new "html" request seen...)

@latest version: uses perl HTML parser from net (with some additions and
bug fixes by me); SafeSurf (NetCondom) removes Java/JavaScript tags; no
longer has problems accidentally nesting <A>'s for refinement tags;
understands new format handoff messages; pathnames for external
distillers now in .cf file, not in code; minor changes to registration
page; "About Pythia" link (to reg page) now appears on every page served
by Pythia; random other buglets fixed.

code that calls gifmunch doesnt work because bogus prefs (empty strings)
being passed.  COROLLARY: get_prefs MUST insure good prefs are returned.

add customization option for bounding box behavior w/r/t size hints

**FORMS DON'T WORK!**  probably "POST" method is messed up

farm out gifmunchers to various machines
provide "gifmuncher config port" and "query port" fnality?  or secret urls.

FOR PRODUCTIZE

Pythia icon to prefs
monitor process: talk to query port,  auto restart when it dies + email
        notification

dealing with size hints: delete them?
why does glomop.gif not load???

Authentication or some way of regulating access
auto restart when it dies (or email notification)
Forward bbox size when munging HTML? (need exact size - not upper bound)
