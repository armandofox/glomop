pythia.prefs removed once and for all.  tcp_sock.pl and
unregistered.html are gone (obsolete).  prefs are now read from

Your machine does not appear to be registered for the Pythia proxy
service.  Unregistered users can only access documents in the
<a href=index.html>GloMop Project Area</a>, which includes a demo area
that illustrates what Pythia proxy service can do for you.

<p>Registration is free and takes only a few seconds.  Help us keep
track of who's using our service.  If you prefer not to register,
<b>unset your HTTP Proxy</b> in your browser's Preferences now.
