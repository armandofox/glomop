@The webproxy is restored!  woo hoo!  (from Spring Break full bkup)
@

@This is both the README and the INSTALL.  You have to install everything
yourself; there is no push-button installation (yet).

  ****  READ THE LICENSE AGREEMENT!  *****

Requirements:
  
- Solaris 5.x or a recent HP-UX if you want to run the GIF distill
  server; if you don't mind running distillation as an external process
  (which is less efficient), any reasonable Un*x variant will do.

- To run the proxy front end: Perl 5.002 or later installed, including
  the Socket and POSIX support modules (part of the standard distribution).
  You can find the latest Perl at various FTP archives including
  ftp.uu.net, archive.cis.ohio-state.edu, jpl-devvax.jpl.nasa.gov; or on
  the Web, try http://www.metronet.com/perlinfo/source.

- The NetPBM header files and libraries.  These are needed for image
  distillation.
   You'll find the latest release of Netpbm at the following sites:
   * wuarchive.wustl.edu (128.252.135.4),
     directory /graphics/graphics/packages/NetPBM
   * ikaros.fysik4.kth.se (130.237.35.2), directory /pub/netpbm.
   * ftp.informatik.uni-oldenburg.de (134.106.1.9). This site also carries
     binaries for the Amiga.
   * peipa.essex.ac.uk (155.245.115.161), directory ipa/src/manip
   * ftp.rahul.net (192.160.13.1), directory /pub/davidsen/source
   * ftp.cs.ubc.ca, directory /ftp/archive/netpbm

- For inline JPEG distillation, cjpeg and djpeg.  These are available
  from the Independent JPEG Group.
  

What to do:

1. Unpack all the sources.  (You've done that already or you wouldn't be here)

*** If you don't need to run the distillation server, 
*** skip to step 4

2. Compile pythsvc (the distillation server library) by going to that
  directory and saying 'gmake'.  You may have to first edit the Makefile
  to reflect the correct paths to the NetPBM include files and libraries.

3. Compile gifmunch by going to that directory and saying 'gmake'.  Same
  Makefile comments apply.  

4. Change the pathname in the #! line of pythia to point to your perl 5.002.

5. Modify pythia.cf to reflect the correct pathnames to everything.  It's
  mostly self documenting.

6. Say "pythia" with some options to start the proxy.  "pythia -h"
  explains most of the options.

7. If pythia hangs or crashes, you have to *manually* do the following:
     - send  'kill -INT' to the parent process (digestproxy.pl)
     - send 'kill -HUP' to any gifmunchers that are still running (this
       shuts them down in a way that makes it likely they will gracefully
       release their sockets)
     - restart pythia

8. After pythia is running, you can start additional gifmunchers
   manually by typing:
        gifmunch <listenport> <pythia-host> <pythia-port>
   <listenport> should be a random port number on the machine on which
      gifmunch will run; it will listen for requests on this port.
   <pythia-host> is the machine on which pythia is running, and
   <pythia-port> is the port on which pythia is listening (the one you
       specify on the pythia command line).

9. pythia.users is the user database.  If you delete it, current users
  will have to re-register and their prefs will be forgotten, but
  everything will still work.
