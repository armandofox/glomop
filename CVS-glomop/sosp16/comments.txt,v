Eric A. sez: 

-generalization of "overflow pool" argument is multiple
priority level overflow pools.

- inktomi/hotbot stuff distracting and doesn't add much

- "incremenatl scaling" principle should be under cost/perf, not under
scalability. 

- "network limitatiosn" sec. should emphasize we do computation on the
"server side" of the data link (like earlier ASPLOS/WWW paper)

- burstiness over large timescales (days/weeks)?  contentious.

- Layered arch section: "simple API" and "composing" are really the
*same* bullet, enabled by the identification of the "composable workers"
class of services

- in "HTMl distiller" bullet in implementation: what about a Killer
Packet that systematically kills it?

- "D=15" in "self tuning and load bal." is an arbitrary constant! ugh!
