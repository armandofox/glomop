\section{Introduction}

Parallel scientific
applications running on massively parallel processors (MPPs)
 commonly exhibit one of a small set of communication patterns
\cite{splash}.  Brewer and Kuszmaul found in a recent study \cite{bk94}
that for large problem sizes, the performance of these codes was limited
by the speed of the interprocessor bulk-transfer facilities available on
the Thinking Machines CM-5.  They identify the fundamental causes of
systematic degradation in bulk-transfer performance on the CM-5 and
offer a communication library called Strata \cite{strata} that
implements a set of 
techniques  to improve it, including barrier synchronization and packet
interleaving.  We wanted
to evaluate the effectiveness of these techniques on other MPPs, 
and to extend them in order to address two issues not covered by
\cite{bk94}:
\begin{itemize}
\item The CM-5's hardware support for fast barriers plays a
	prominent role in  Strata; we wanted to explore
	the implications of synthesizing software barriers, which are
        more common on most existing MPPs.  Compared to hardware
barriers, software barriers suffer
	higher latency and scale less effectively.
\item The most effective Strata techniques apply primarily to the
        all-pairs permutation communication pattern.  We wanted to
        extend the Strata ideas to a wider range of
        communication patterns.
% \item The Strata techniques were evaluated with fixed-sized data
% 	transfers. Our final goal was to investigate methods for improving
% 	the performance of communication patterns which involve
% 	variable sized blocks. 
\end{itemize}
