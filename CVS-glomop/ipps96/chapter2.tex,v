@ \section{Strata on Three Machines}
\label{strata}

In this section we present the results of implementing and measuring the
performance of the Strata techniques evaluated in \cite{bk94} on a
64-node Thinking Machines
CM-5, a 4-node MIT Alewife machine, and an 8-node Intel Paragon.
Contrary to intuition, this sentence must be included in order to coerce
\LaTeX to typeset the paper within the 7-page limit imposed by IPPS.
% The network
% characteristics of these machines that are of concern for our experiments are
% summarized in table \ref{threemachines}.

A trio of graphs, figures \ref{stcm5} through \ref{stalewife}, presents our
measured results of two Strata techniques.  
\begin{itemize}

\item{The CSHIFT curve shows the
effective bandwidth achieved by uncoordinated cyclic-shift permutation
traffic as a function of block size; this corresponds to a naively coded
application exhibiting regular all-pairs communication.}

\item{The
CSHIFT+Barriers curve shows the improvement in performance achieved by
separating the permutations within each round with barriers (hardware
barriers on the CM-5, software barriers on the other platforms), which
is the most effective technique proposed by Brewer and Kuszmaul.}

\item{The
Random curve shows the effective bandwidth achieved by a random traffic
pattern, representative of irregular communication patterns.  Our
benchmark generates this traffic by having each source randomly choose
destinations.} 

\item{Finally, the
Random Interleaved curve shows the improvement on random traffic by
interleaving packets destined for different receivers rather than
sending each large block to its receiver serially; interleaving was the
best technique demonstrated in \cite{bk94} for dealing with irregular
traffic.}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Discussion}

We include our numbers for the
CM-5 for the sake of completeness, although they essentially agree with the
graphs from \cite{bk94}.  The legend on the Alewife graph includes a note
concerning the injection (fragmentation) size used for each algorithm. As 
discussed in \cite{theoretical-network-paper-from-294}, large packet sizes lead
to poor flow through the network and erratic arrival times. The different
algorithms had different ``breaking points'' at which the large packet size
caused wild fluctuations in performance.  For each
curve, we chose an
injection size below this threshold.

The independent axis of each graph shows the block size of data
being sent. Approximately the same overall amount of data was
transferred at each point on the graph; this took more rounds for
small block sizes than for larger sizes.  
The total amount of data sent varied from platform to platform, but
was held constant across all the experiments on each platform.
The dependent axis shows the average {\em achieved} bandwidth,
as opposed to each platform's 
maximum
point-to-point bandwidth.  We believe
achievable bandwidth is a more useful metric, because
it can be used to 
compute a lower bound on the running time of a SPMD problem more directly than
can  point-to-point bandwidth.

Since the Paragon has only 8 nodes, the best performance figures
were obtained by using a large data fragmentation size.  In systems with
more nodes there is a definite win in using smaller injection sizes
\cite{theoretical-network-paper-from-294} to improve message flow
through routers and links in the network.  In the 8-node Paragon there
is little incentive to do this, since there are few routers that a
given message will pass through, and the startup cost of the DMA transfer
engine is very high. The 8K byte injection size maximizes the
achieved bandwidth, but gives little advantage to interleaving. 

Permutations with barriers produces dramatic improvement on all
machines for sufficiently large block sizes, particularly on
on the CM-5 with its fast hardware barriers.  
On the Paragon and Alewife, software-synthesized tree barriers are still
a win for all but the smallest block sizes.
