\subsection{Motivation}

The results from \cite{bk94} and those presented earlier in this
paper confirm that using permutations and barriers or tokens is 
an effective method of speeding up bulk-transfer. 
Our second goal was
to bring the advantages of 1-on-1 communication to bear
on irregular traffic.

%Recall that for unknown traffic, tokens must be managed by the receiver
%since each sender has no way to compute the next sender to whom the
%token should be passed.  However, when the RQ token algorithm is used
%with random distribution traffic the results are disappointing.  The
%low performance can be explained as follows.  Each sender chooses a
%random destination and registers with the receiver; it must then wait
%for the appropriate token to arrive before it can begin transmitting.  The
%randomness of the traffic results in multiple senders all blocking on
%the same token. They sit idle even though it is likely that they have
%traffic for other destinations they could be making progress on.  This
%phenomenon is known as {\em head-of-line blocking} and can occur in
%network interfaces that have only a single logical output direction.

RQ tokens suffer from head of line blocking,
demonstrating that 1-on-1 communication is not
enough to ensure good performance.  We must also ensure that there are
few idle senders and receivers, since network bandwidth is
wasted while they are idle. The goal of dynamic scheduling is to
achieve 1-on-1 communication with few idle senders or receivers.
