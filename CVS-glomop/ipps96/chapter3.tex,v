\section{Tokens}
\label{tokenpass}
% Separating permutations with barriers is one method of enforcing
% 1-on-1  communication. This section presents a more direct,
% scalable, and efficient technique for doing this. We will discuss the
% problems with barriers, describe the proposed token-passing mechanism,
% and present comparisons between the performance of the two methods.
