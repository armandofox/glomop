    Enhancements to ftpget
    ----------------------

	The `ftpget' program has been enhanced in a number of ways.  It
	is now possible to pass command line options to ftpget from the
	cache.  A new configuration parameter has been added called
	`cache_ftp_options'.

	The supported options are:

        -c num[:delay]  Max connect attempts and retry delay
        -l num[:delay]  Max login attempts and retry delay
        -r num[:delay]  Max restart attempts and retry delay
        -t seconds      Idle timeout
        -n seconds      Negative TTL
        -p path         Icon URL prefix
        -s .ext         Icon URL suffix
        -h              Convert to HTTP
        -R              DON'T get README file
        -w chars        Filename width in directory listing
        -W              Wrap long filenames
        -Ddbg           Debug options
        -v              Version

	-c num[:delay]

		This specifices how many times ftpget should attempt
		the connect() system call.  The default value is 1.  If
		`num' is greater than 1, ftpget will wait `delay'
		seconds before trying to connect again.  The default
		delay value is 3 seconds.

        -l num[:delay]

		Even after a successful connect, there may be
		difficulty getting logged in.  Usually this is due to
		very a busy FTP server.  This value is the number of
		times to try logging in.  The default value is 1 and
		the default retry delay is 30 seconds.

		Note that after a failed login attempt, the control
		connection is closed.  This means that the connect
		counter will get incremented also, so the connect
		retry value should be at least as large as the
		login retry value.

        -r num[:delay]

		Occasionally an FTP transfer may fail before finishing.
		When this occurs, ftpget may be able to restart the
		transfer where it previously left off.  This depends
		on the remote FTP server supporting the `REST' command.
		Ftpget will try to restart failed transfers `num' 
		times and wait `delay' seconds between them.  The default
		values are 1 retry and 3 seconds delay.

        -t seconds

		This is the idle timeout value.  If no data is read
		after this many seconds, the transfer is aborted.  The
		request will be retried subject to the retry options
		listed above.  

		If not specified in the `cache_ftp_options' then this
		value will be set to the `read_timeout' which defaults
		to 15 minutes.

        -n seconds

		The Negative TTL for failed requests.  This defaults to
		the same as `negative_ttl' from the cached.conf file, but
		can be overridden in the `cache_ftp_options'.

		
        -p path         Icon URL prefix
        -s .ext         Icon URL suffix

		These two options are for using specific bitmap icons
		in the ftpget directory listings.  Normally, the  listings
		generated by ftpget use "browser internal" icons which can
		vary from browser to browser, or might not be supported
		at all.  To use real icon objects, you might write

			-p http://cache.my.domain/icons/
			-s .xbm

        -h
	
		This flag tells ftpget to output an HTTP object.  This
		flag is always set by the cache, it should not appear
		in the `cache_ftp_options'

        -R

		Use this flag to skip checking for a README file
		in directory listings.

        -w chars

		The width of a directory listing.  The default is 32.

        -W

		If this flag is set, lines longer than the width above
		will be wrapped around to the next line.  Otherwise
		long lines will be truncated.

        -Ddbg

		When debugging ftpget from the command line, it may
		be helpful to add "-D26,9".

        -v

		Print ftpget version and exit.
