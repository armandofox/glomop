@This directory used to contain the Tcl/Tk interface to the Harvest Cache
Manager.

We no longer support the tk/tcl cache manager due to its complexity.
Instead we provide a CGI cache manager interface.  

The CGI program (cachemgr.c) is found in the ../server directory
and gets installed in $(prefix)/cgi-bin.
