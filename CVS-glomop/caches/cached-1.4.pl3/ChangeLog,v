@Changes to the v1.4pl3 release ():

	- Fixed config.h to set _HARVEST_SYSV_ for Solaris cc.
	- Fixed ftpget to parse NT listings better.
	- Fixed ip_access_check casting problems
	- Fixed cache_hierarchy_log being owned by root when using
	  cache_effective_user.
	- Fixed parse_rfc850 to return -1 instead of 0 on error because
	  0 is valid for the epoch.
	- stat: made some functions void which always returned same int
	- neighbors: fixed server_list coredump 
	- added LOG_ERRORS #ifdef
	- PBD ipcache fix
	- http:   fixed POST content-length bug
	- cache_cf: Added cache_ftp_options config
	- ttl:    fixed detection of Netscape unauthorized return code.
	- ftpget: added -p iconpath -s iconsuffix options
	- ftpget: fixed coredump on blank lines and other odd 'LIST' outputs.
	- WAIS:   fixed never calling waisStart from proto.c.

Changes to the v1.4pl2 release (Jan 20, 1996):

	- Fixed coredump bug caused by using wrong values in memset().

Changes to the v1.4pl1 release (Jan 17, 1996):

	- Added mkdir $(prefix) in the top Makefile.
	- Clarified cached.conf comments about quick_abort.
	- Fixed logfile rotations off-by-one error (looking
	  for non-existant log.-1).
	- Changed conditions for which we return UDP_HIT.  Now only if
	  the object will not expire for at least another 5 minutes.
	  This prevents a UDP_HIT to be followed by a TCP_MISS_TTL
	  which may cause neighbors to deadlock.
	- Changed N_UPPER_CACHES from hard-coded #define to a variable.
	  Now allocate exactly enough slots for all neighbors and
	  parents in cached.conf.
	- Fixed never seeing REVIVE_PARENT message.
	- Changed storeRebuild timestamp max delta from 5 to 2 seconds
	  for better consistency on reload.
	- Fixed cached to not exit if mkdir() says EEXIST.
	- Significant changes/fixes to ftpget.c:
		- Try PASV first, then try PORT.
		- Try to RETR the object before trying to CWD to it.
		  (needed to work with buggy Windows NT ftpd).
		- Close unused FD's from trying to grab README.
		- Use relative URLs in directory listings.
		- Only include a BASE HREF if absolutely necessary.
		- Changed directory listing to use "LIST" instead of
		  "LIST -l".
		- Include any informational ftpd replies in the	error
		  page.
		- Verified to work much better with:
			Windows NT
			Netware
	- Added the cached.conf read_timeout on the ftpget command line.
	- Fixed a bug when checking return code from child ftpget 
	  processes.  Eliminated call to kill_zombie() so now
	  all child process deaths go through sig_child().
	- Fixed RunCache to detect frequent failures and give up.
	- Increased some cached.conf defaults:
		changed client_lifetime from 15 minutes to 3+ hours.
		changed max object sizes from 1M to 4M.
		changed read_timeout from 5 minutes to 15 minutes.
		changed dns_children from 3 to 5.
	- Changed hierarchy logging for source_ping's.  Now logged
	  as SOURCE_FASTEST followed by the IP addresses of the
	  source host.

Summary of significant changes between versions 1.3.pl2 and 1.4.pl0:

	Please see the "Release-Notes-1.4.txt" file for a full
	description of additions and changes.

	- Fast restart mode:  If the cache is shutdown "cleanly" then
	  the next restart will be much faster.
	- C ftpget:  The Perl version of ftpget has been replaced with a
	  more reliable C version.
	- CGI cachemanager:  The tcl/tk cache manager has been replaced
	  with a CGI script.
	- Domain routing to parent caches:  It is possible to configure
	  parents and neighbors to handle URLs only in specific domains.
	- Improved operation behind a firewall.
	- Most memory allocation is now from a pool of fixed size
	  blocks.  This greatly reduces memory fragmentation and the
	  number of calls to malloc/free.
	- Deal with file descriptor shortages.  When the cache begins to
	  run out of FD's we begin denying new connections so requests
	  already in progress will be able to complete.
	- Simple virtual host support.
	- Detection of dead parents and neighbors.
	- Cache swap files can be spread across multiple partitions.
	- separate IP ACLs for proxy and httpd-accel accesses.
	- Many more performance enhancments and bug fixes.

Changes to the v1.4pl0 release (Dec 19, 1995):

	- Fixed 'Skip-neighbor-pinging-for-POST-and-HEAD-requests' to
	  skip for all uncachable requests (ie some GETs too).
	- Changed cache and hierarchy logs to be buffered unless a -d
	  command line option is given.
	- Changed fatal signal handlers to call storeWriteCleanLog()
	  (so the next restart would be in FAST MODE).  If -C is given,
	  don't call storeWriteCleanLog().
	- Don't exit if the swap space fills up.  Just keep printing
	  error messages.
	- Added support programs for a UDP-based cache announcement
	  service.  Replaces the old email-based cache-tracker.
	- Removed hard-coded default shutdown password.
	- use HARVESTHOSTNAMELEN instead of MAXHOSTNAMELEN which

Changes to the v1.4.beta23 release (Dec 17):

	- Fixed sscanf() coredump bug in protoUndispatch().
	- Changed ftpget to send HTTP success header after RETR or LIST
	  command, instead of after PORT command.

Changes to the v1.4.beta22 release (Dec 16):

	- Added fast-reload mode on startup if the cache was previously
	  shutdown cleanly.  Reloads an order of magnitude faster.
	- Skip neighbor pinging for POST and HEAD requests.
	- Fixed asciiHandleConn() coredump for IP access denied message.
	- Fixed handling usernames and passwords in FTP URLs.

Changes to the v1.4.beta21 release ():

	- Fixed protoDNSError() coredump bug.  Now call protoCancelTimeout()
	  to avoid the double fetch and resulting coredump.
	- Return COMM_ERROR in comm_accept() if we run out of FDs.
	- Changed to using enumerated type for parent/neighbor.
	- Fixed icpSendERRORComplete() coredump bug to do memory
	  deallocation right.

Changes to the v1.4.beta20 release (Dec 14, 1995):

	- Fixed httpSendComplete() coredump bug.
	- Fixed erroneous call to abort() in comm_close().
	- Changed log() to Log() in libutil.a.

Changes to the v1.4.beta19 release (Dec 14, 1995):

	- Changed whichEdge() to not call ipcache_gethostbyname().
	  Instead maintain a list of IP addresses in the edge structure.
	- Fixed gopher coredump bug when mime_ext_to_type() returns NULL.
	- Removed cachemgr.cgi menu entries for works-in-progress.
	- Changed RESERVE_FD code to allow SunOS to reserve yet more of them.
	- Fixed storeWriteCleanLog() coredump bug on invalid objects.
	- Fixed not invoking handlers after reading 0 bytes.
	- Fixed serious bugs in filemap code; now works on 64-bit systems.

Changes to the v1.4.beta18 release (Dec 12, 1995):

	- Fixed source_ping to work again (bug introduced in beta14?).
	- Remove src/server/mime_table.h (use src/include/mime_table.h).
	- Fixed coredump when ICP (UDP) port is disabled.

Changes to the v1.4.beta17 release (Dec 11, 1995):

	- Changed ftpget.c to not grab the README file if the CWD command
	  reply contained message text (which is shown instead).
	- Fixed cachemgr.cgi always giving the "Unknown CGI command"
	  error.
	- Fixed RunCache trying to locate ftpget.pl
	- Removed httpd_accel IP ACL check for ICP packets.
	- Fixed hierarchy logging for 'emulate_httpd_log off' mode.
	- Changed server selection algorithm (when doing a direct fetch)
	  to make sure the source hostname is valid before calling
	  http/gopher/ftp modules.
	- Removed getpeername() calls in server-side Lifetime handlers
	  due to their potential to block.
	- Added some (hopefully) useful Perl scripts to src/scripts
	  directory.
	- Fixed crash on neighbor_timeout line in config file.
	- Fixed lots of memory leaks associated with lifetime handlers
	  expiring.
	- Eliminated calls to xcallocs() in stat.c and http.c.
	- Modifed all uses of icpRead() and icpWrite() to use 4k buffers rather
	  than strings 
	- Fixed bug in quick_abort mode that caused other readers of
	  an aborted object from getting slammed by the first reader
	  to hop off.
	- fixed SIGHUP handler to reset itself on SYSV unixes.
	- Fixed dnsserver to use buffered fgets() instead of read()
	  (bug introduced in beta15).
	- Fixed missing filenames on cachemgr/info page (bug introduced
	  beta16).
	- Added logfile_rotate to cached.conf.
	- Added check for cache_object:// objects so we don't ping the
	  hierarchy for them.
	- Rewrote the ipcache dump routine to avoid a big xcalloc().
	- Added the domain list to the neighbor instrumentation.
	- Fixed some objects getting "stranded" if the client timeout
	  occurs before the DNS lookup comes back.
	- Fixed byte statistics right for utilization page; including
	  adding a new category for aborted objects.
	- Fixed hardcoded port numbers.  Now defined in src/include/config.h
	  and customizable in src/server/Makefile.  Also provided for
	  building cachemgr.cgi with a default cache host name.
	- Fixed FTP negative caching.
	- Fixed handling of errors while swapping in a cached object.
	- Fixed filemap code for 64-bit architectures.  Probably the
	  cause of unrelated objects being returned.
	- Poll UDP read/write queue every time through the select loop to
	  reduce UDP buffer overflow.
	- Prevent coredump if neighbor/parent replies with from a
	  different IP address.
	- Fixed memory deallocation in disk write handlers.

Changes to the v1.4.beta16 release (Dec 6, 1995):

	- Fixed getSingleParent() sometimes returning a neighbor
	  as the single parent.
	- Applied patch for problems found by lint (from
	  ed@@fatboy.geog.unsw.EDU.AU)
	- Fixed hierarchy logging to not mis-log some things as TIMEOUT.
	- Fixed quickabort mode: quick aborts no longer eject clean objects
	  from the cache.
	- General cleanup of storage manager code, esp object locks.
	- Removed the tcl/tk cache manager program from the distribution.
	  We now support only the CGI cache manager.
	- Added "Refresh Object" to cache manager operations.

Changes to the v1.4.beta15 release (Dec 6, 1995):

	- Fixed bug which caused two simultaneous fetches of an
	  object resulting in "mixed-up" object data.  Probably
	  the source of coredumps too.
	- Added simple virtual_host support (for httpd_accel mode)
	  with -V command line option.  Rewrites the URL with the
	  IP address of the local socket as the hostname.
	- Changed dnsserver to communicate with cached via a UNIX
	  domain socket instead of a pipe.  This saves one file
	  descriptor per dnsserver.
	  
Changes to the v1.4.beta14 release (Dec 5, 1995):

	- Added 'Expires:' header to ftpget failures.
	- Fixed logic mixup in storeEntryLocked().
	- Fixed potential FD leak in gopher.c.
	- Added detection of dead non-Harvest parent caches.
	- Changed how to specify that objects fetched from neighbors caches
	  not be cached locally.  The 'cache_neighbor_obj' tag is no
	  longer used.  Instead, use 'proxy-only' at the end of a cahe_host
	  line.  For example:

		cache_host  near.net	neighbor 3128 3130  proxy-only
		cache_host  far.net     neighbor 3128 3130

	  This would cause objects fetched from 'far.net' to be cached
	  locally, but not those from 'near.net'.

	- SIGNIFICANT CHANGE TO SERVER SELECTION CONFIGURATION AND ALGORITHM:

	  The following config tags are no longer in use:

		direct_fetch    on|off
		behind_firewall on|off

	  The following config tags have been added:

		inside_firewall  domain  [domain ...]
		local_domain     domain  [domain ...]
		single_parent_bypass  on|off

	  Please see the 'cached.conf' comments and the Release Notes
	  for further details on these configuration parameters.

Changes to the v1.4.beta13 release (Dec 4, 1995):

	- Fixed small bug with getSingleParent().
	- Added connection timeouts, prompted by Linux not ever
	  timing out connect() requests.  The config parameter
	  'connect_timeout' is used to set the timeout value.
	- Fixed another place where a second request for an object being
	  swapped in from disk causes invalid memory accesses.
	- Fixed FD leak associated with swapinstart failures.
	- Added two calls to ftp_close_pipe that was casuing us to accumulate
	  state in the ftp_close_pipe queue.
	- Changed ftplifetimeExpire so that comm_close works right on Linux.
	- Minor documentation improvement including renaming icpProcessSENDA
	  to icpProcessMISS.
	- Added log message: TCP_MISS_SWAP_FILE_OPEN_FAILED.
	- Changed pool accounting and modified to show in-transit byte
	  count in stat.c.
	- Increased constant SWAP_HELP a bunch.
	- Swapfiles now start at 0 again, so cached picks up after itself.
	- Removed latent bug related to running out of swapfile numbers.
	- Page-ified memory allocation in gopher.c to 4KB blocks.
	- Added an 8KB page allocator in stmem.c and
	  Used this allocator in store.c for swapins and swapouts.
	- Modified stat.c to show the amount of buffer space devoted
	  to 8KB blocks.
	- Added storetoString.c and modified a few of the
	  consistency checks in store.c to call it before aborting.

Changes to the v1.4.beta12 release (Dec 2, 1995):

	- Fixed checking for zero-length objects.
	- Added 'limit core un' to RunCache and RunAccel
	- Changed 'stmem' module to use fixed-size chunks of memory
	  allocated from a pool.
	- Changed dnsserver to not return host aliases which we never
	  use anyway.

Changes to the v1.4.beta11 release (Dec 2, 1995):

	- Changed single_parent stuff.  Now use getSingleParent(host), so
	  it is hostname dependent.  Check for a single parent before
	  hierarchy pinging (as before).  This should allow better mixing
	  of behind_firewall and cache_host_domain configurations.
	- Made direct_fetch depend on having a default parent.  The
	  default parent still must have no domain restirctions.  If
	  direct_fetch is 'off' and a default parent was not found,
	  exit with an error.
	- Removed extra newline on fatal() messages.
	- Removed printing duplicate fatal() message to stderr.
	- Changed mallinfo() stats to print only if we service some
	  requests (not if we exit due to config problems).
	- Call StoreAbort() for zero-length retrievals.
	- storeGetSwapSpace() coredump fix:  Only reclaim object's space when:
	  mem_status      swap_status         status 
	  !SWAPPING_IN    !SWAP_IN_PROGRESS   !STORE_PENDING 


Changes to the v1.4.beta10 release (Dec 1, 1995):

	- Changed all CLIENT_ABORT'ed objects to be instantly removed
	  from the cache (instead of negative-cached).
	- Fixed single_parent w/o default_parent coredump bug.

Changes to the v1.4.beta9 release (Dec 1, 1995):

	- Call commSetNonBlock() after accept() just to be sure new
	  connection is also non-blocking.
	- Add better error reporting from xmalloc(), et al.
	- Fix 'client' to send 'Accept: */*'.
	- Increase stacklimit in stack.h to 200, as a way to decrease
	  memory fragmentation.
	- Added GNUmalloc to the source distribution.  To use, uncomment
	  '# GNUmalloc' in src/Makefile
	- Changed cache log output to use 'mkhttpdtime()' just like
	  access and hierarchy logs (now all logs in the same timezone!).
	  However cache log always uses converted time and never the
	  epoch-seconds.

Changes to the v1.4.beta8 release (Nov 30, 1995):

	- Added setting close-on-exec flag to most filedescriptors.
	- Fixed big typo causing 'hot_vm_factor' warnings.
	- Changed comm_port() to detect closed sockets before calling
	  getsockname().
	- Fix APPEND_DOMAIN memory mgmt problems, and remove APPEND_DOMAIN
	  #ifdefs.  Its now always compiled in.
	- Added shutdown and password into cachemgr.cgi.
	- Fixed neighbor ping algorithm.  Now the default parent can not
	  have any domain restrictions.
	- Changed time format in hierarchy log to be the same as in 
	  access log.

Changes to the v1.4.beta7 release (Nov 28, 1995):

	- Fixed neighbor logging by using "a" in fdopen() instead of "w".
	- Fixed Gopher by removing extra CRLF pair in HTTP reply header.

Changes to the v1.4.beta6 release (Nov 28, 1995):

	- Fixed stdin,stdout,stderr in filedescriptor stats output (was
	  causing coredumps on some machines).
	- print message if setting SO_REUSEADDR fails
	- Changed HTTP request parsing to also use TAB characters as a
	  delimiter.
	- Fixed rw_state->buf and astm->url may point to same place
	- Fixed Gopher typing.
	- Fixed APPEND_DOMAIN to use new config structure
	- Added neighbor_timeout as a configurable parameter.  Default
	  is two seconds.
	- Added more debugging for comm_udp_sendto() failures.
	- Changed bind(2) error message to not use "0.0.0.0".
	- Added "Terminated abnormally" message to cache.log.

Changes to the v1.4.beta5 release (Nov 22, 1995):

	- Fixed erroneous neighbor instrumentation (and coredump bug
	  when source_ping is 'on').
	- call storeGetSwapSpace() every time in storeMaintainSwapSpace().

Changes to the v1.4.beta4 release (Nov 21, 1995):

	- Added direct_fetch mode.  When on (the default) the cache is
	  allowed to fetch an object directly from the source server.
	- Changed clean_rate (garbage collection) to be disabled by default.
	_ Changed cache_hot_vm_factor to be zero by default.  Also force
	  it to be zero when running in proxy mode.
	- Changed RESERVED_FD algorithm to reserve min(100, getMaxFD()/4).
	- Fixed FTP coredump bug:  "storeGetMemSpace() is reclaiming the
	  object despite the fact that we're swapping it in".
	- Changed main loop (main.c) to not call storeMaintainSwapSpace()
	  more than once per second.
	- Fixed hierarchy logging bug from beta3.
	- Don't build and install ftpget.pl and support files.  They are
	  still included in the source distribution.
	- Added neighbor/parent instrumentation available from the
	  cachemgr interface.

Changes to the v1.4.beta3 release (Nov 17, 1995):

	- Changed ftpget.c and ftp.c for improved detection of failed
	  FTP requests.  Now use ftpget exit code as an indication
	  of level of failure.
	- Added more file descriptors to cachemgr "Cache Information"
	  page.
	- Added -z option to cached command line in RunAccel.  Now by
	  default RunAccel zaps its cache files on startup.

Changes between release v1.2 (April 3, 1995) and v1.1:

- Changes to the Cache:
        - Added httpd accelerator support.
        - Added IP number logging.
        - Added setuid() to a user when cached is run as root.
        - Added support for HTTP servers that die abruptly.
        - Added client_timeout which places a hard limit on the life
          of incoming connections on the ascii port, or on outgoing
          HTTP or Gopher clients.
        - Cleaner implementation for retrieving FTP URLs via ftpget.pl.
        - Tries to write cached.pid file in same directory as cached.conf.
        - Changed FTP support to sacrifice correct HTTP headers for 
          dramatically decreased latency for large FTP objects.
        - Fixed ftpget.pl -htmlify to determine directory vs. file 
          correctly and send HTTP header as soon as possible.

        - Minor modification of store error message.
        - Remote client connection resets are handled as soft error.
        - Strip an extra /r/n from MIME.
