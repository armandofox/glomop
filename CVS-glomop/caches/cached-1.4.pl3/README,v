@This is a special distribution that contains only the Harvest object
cache.  The cache is an element of the Harvest Information Discovery and
Access System, offering high performance proxy caching for Mosaic,
Netscape, Lynx, and other World Wide Web clients.  It supports URLs via
HTTP, FTP, and Gopher.

The Harvest cache outperforms other popular Internet caches (such as the
CERN cache) by a factor of 10-100, because the Harvest cache never
forks, is implemented with non-blocking I/O, keeps meta data and
especially hot objects cached in RAM, caches DNS lookups, supports
non-blocking DNS lookups, and implements negative caching both of
objects and of DNS lookups.  A technical paper discussing the Harvest
cache and providing performance comparisions is available from
ftp://ftp.cs.colorado.edu/pub/cs/techreports/schwartz/HarvestCache.ps.Z

The Harvest cache may also be run as an ``accelerator'' for HTTP servers, as
described in http://harvest.cs.colorado.edu/harvest/httpd_accel.html

You can learn more about the overall Harvest system starting from the
Harvest Home Page at http://harvest.cs.colorado.edu/

Harvest documentation is on-line at
http://harvest.cs.colorado.edu/harvest/doc.html
