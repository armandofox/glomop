#  TAG: http_port
#	The port number where squid will listen for HTTP client
#	requests.  Default is 3128, for httpd-accel mode use port 80.
#	May be overridden with -a on the command line.
#
#http_port 3128

#  TAG: icp_port
#	The port number where squid send and receive ICP requests to
#	and from neighbor caches.  Default is 3130.  To disable use
#	"0".  May be overridden with -u on the command line.
#
#icp_port 3130

#  TAG: mcast_groups
#       This tag specifies a list of multicast groups which your
#       server should join to receive multicasted ICP requests.
#
#	NOTE!  Be very careful what you put here!  Be sure you
#	understand the difference between an ICP _query_ and an ICP
#	_reply_.  This option is to be set only if you want to RECEIVE
#	multicast queries.  Do NOT set this option to SEND multicast
#	ICP (use cache_host for that).  ICP replies are always sent via
#	unicast, so this option does not affect whether or not you will
#	receive replies from multicast group members.
#
#	You must be very careful to NOT use a multicast address which
#	is already in use by another group of caches.  NLANR has been
#	assigned a block of multicast address space for use in Web
#	Caching.  Plese write to us at nlanr-cache@@nlanr.net to receive
#	an address for your own use.
#
#       Usage:  mcast_groups 239.128.16.128 224.0.1.20
#
#       By default, squid doesn't listen on any multicast groups.

#
#	Usage: tcp_incoming_address 10.20.30.40
#	       udp_outgoing_address fully.qualified.domain.name
#
#	These tags have replaced 'bind_address' and 'outbound_address'
#	to provide more control for multihomed hosts.
#
#	tcp_incoming_address	is used for the HTTP socket which accepts
#				connections from clients and other caches.
#	tcp_outgoing_address	is used for connections made to remote
#				servers and other caches.
#	udp_incoming_address	is used for the ICP socket receiving packets
#				from other caches.
#	udp_outgoing_address	is used for ICP packets sent out to other
#				caches.
#
#	The defaults behaviour is to not bind to any specific address.
#
#	NOTE, udp_incoming_address and udp_outgoing_address can not have
#	the same value since they both use port 3130.

# OPTIONS WHICH AFFECT THE NEIGHBOR SELECTION ALGORITHM
#-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

#  TAG: cache_host
#	To specify other caches in a hierarchy, use the format:
#
#	    hostname type http_port icp_port
#
#   For example,
#
#	#                                        proxy  icp
#	#          hostname             type     port   port  options
#	#          -------------------- -------- ----- -----  -----------
#	cache_host bigserver.usc.edu    parent    3128  3130  [proxy-only]
#	cache_host littleguy1.usc.edu   sibling   3128  3130  [proxy-only]
#	cache_host littleguy1.usc.edu   sibling   3128  3130  [proxy-only]
#
#	      type:  either 'parent', 'sibling', or 'multicast'.
#
#	proxy_port:  The port number where the cache listens for proxy
#	             requests.
#
#	  icp_port:  Used for querying neighbor caches about
#	             objects.  To have a non-ICP neighbor
#	             specify '7' for the ICP port and make sure the
#	             neighbor machine has the UDP echo port
#	             enabled in its /etc/inetd.conf file.
#
#	    options: proxy-only
#		     weight=n
#		     ttl=n
#		     no-query
#		     default
#		     round-robin
#		     multicast-responder
#
#		     use 'proxy-only' to specify that objects fetched
#		     from this cache should not be saved locally.
#
#		     use 'weight=n' to specify a weighted parent.
#		     The weight must be an integer.  The default weight
#		     is 1, larger weights are favored more.
#
#                    use 'ttl=n' to specify a IP multicast TTL to use
#                    when sending an ICP request to this address.
#                    Only useful when sending to a multicast group.
#		     Because we don't accept ICP replies from random
#		     hosts, you must configure other group members as
#		     peers with the 'multicast-responder' option below.
#
#		     use 'no-query' to NOT send ICP queries to this
#		     neighbor.
#
#		     use 'default' if this is a parent cache which can
#		     be used as a "last-resort." You should probably
#		     only use 'default' in situations where you cannot
#		     use ICP with your parent cache(s).
#
#		     use 'round-robin' to define a set of parents which
#		     should be used in a round-robin fashion in the
#		     absence of any ICP queries.
#
#		     'multicast-responder' indicates that the named peer
#		     is a member of a multicast group.  ICP queries will
#		     not be sent directly to the peer, but ICP replies
#		     will be accepted from it.
#
#	NOTE: non-ICP neighbors must be specified as 'parent'.
#
#cache_host hostname type 3128 3130

#  TAG: cache_host_domain
#	Use to limit the domains for which a neighbor cache will be queried.
#	Usage:
#
#	cache_host_domain cache-host domain [domain ...]
#	cache_host_domain cache-host !domain
#
#	For example, specifying
#
#		cache_host_domain bigserver.usc.edu	.edu
#
#	has the effect such that UDP query packets are sent to
#	'bigserver' only when the requested object exists on a
#	server in the .edu domain.  Prefixing the domainname
#	with '!' means that the cache will be queried for objects
#	NOT in that domain.
#
#	NOTE:	* Any number of domains may be given for a cache-host,
#		  either on the same or separate lines.
#		* When multiple domains are given for a particular
#		  cache-host, the first matched domain is applied.
#		* Cache hosts with no domain restrictions are queried
#		  for all requests.
#		* There are no defaults.
#		* There is also a 'cache_host_acl' tag in the ACL
#		  section.

#  TAG: neighbor_type_domain
#
#	usage: neighbor_type_domain parent|sibling domain domain ...
#
#	Modifying the neighbor type for specific domains is now
#	possible.  You can treat some domains differently than the the
#	default neighbor type specified on the 'cache_host' line.
#	Normally it should only be necessary to list domains which
#	should be treated differently because the default neighbor type
#	applies for hostnames which do not match domains listed here.
#
#EXAMPLE:
#	cache_host  parent cache.foo.org 3128 3130
#	neighbor_type_domain cache.foo.org sibling .com .net
#	neighbor_type_domain cache.foo.org sibling .au .de

#  TAG:	inside_firewall
#	This tag specifies a list of domains inside your Internet
#	firewall.
#
#	Usage: inside_firewall my.domain  [ my.other.domain ...]
#	       !out.my.domain my.domain
#
#	The use of this tag affects the server selection algorithm in
#	two ways.  Objects which do not match any of the listed domains
#	will be considered "beyond the firewall."  For these:
#		- There will be no DNS lookups for the URL-host.
#		- The object will always be fetched from one of
#		  the parent or neighbor caches.
#
#	As a special case you may specify the domain as 'none' to force
#	all requests to be fetched from neghbors and parents.
#	Prefixing a domain name with '!' means the domain is NOT inside
#	your firewall.
#
#inside_firewall topsecret.com

#  TAG:	local_domain
#	This tag specifies a list of domains local to your organization.
#
#	Usage: local_domain my.domain [ my.other.domain ...]
#
#	For URLs which are in one of the local domains, the object
#	is always fetched directly from the source and never from a
#	neighbor or parent.
#
#local_domain bigbucks.com

#  TAG: local_ip
#	This tag specifies a list of network addresses local to your
#	organization.
#
#	Usage: local_ip ip-address
#
#	This tag is similar to local_domain, except that the IP-address
#	of the URL-host is checked.  This requires that a DNS lookup
#	be done on the URL-host.  For this reason, local_domain is
#	preferred over local_ip.  By using local_domain it may be
#	possible to avoid the DNS lookup altogether and deliver the
#	object with less delay.
#
#local_ip 10.0.0.0
#local_ip 172.16.0.0

#  TAG: firewall_ip
#
#	Just like 'inside_firewall' but for IP addresses.  NOTE:
#	firewall_ip and local_ip are mutually exclusive.  If you
#	use firewall_ip then local_ip will be ignored.
#
#firewall_ip 10.0.0.0
#firewall_ip 172.16.0.0

#  TAG:	single_parent_bypass
#	This tag specifies that it is okay to bypass the hierarchy
#	"Pinging" when there is only a single parent for a given URL.
#
#	Usage: single_parent_bypass on|off
#
#	Before actually sending ICP "ping" packets to parents and
#	neighbors, we figure out which hosts would be pinged based
#	on the cache_host_domain rules, etc.  Often it may be the
#	case that only a single parent cache would be pinged.
#
#	Since there is only a single parent, there is a very good
#	chance that we will end up fetching the object from that
#	parent.  For this reason, it may be beneficial to avoid
#	the ping and just fetch the object anyway.
#
#	However, if we avoid the ping, we will be assuming that the
#	parent host is reachable and that the cache process is running.
#	By using the ping, we can be reasonably sure that the parent
#	host will be able to handle our request.  If the ping fails then
#	it may be possible to fetch the object directly from the source.
#
#	To favor the resiliency provided by the ping algorithm,
#	single_parent_bypass is 'off' by default.
#
#single_parent_bypass off

#  TAG: source_ping
#	If source_ping is enabled, then squid will include the source
#	provider site in its selection algorithm.  This is accomplished
#	by sending ICP "HIT" packets to the UDP echo port of the source
#	host.  Note that using source_ping may send a fair amount of UDP
#	traffic out on the Internet and may irritate paranoid network
#	administrators.
#
#	Note that source_ping is incompatible with inside_firewall.
#	For hosts beyond the firewall, source_ping packets will never
#	be sent.
#
#	By default, source_ping is off.
#
#source_ping off

#  TAG: neighbor_timeout (seconds)
#	This controls how long to wait for replies from neighbor caches.
#	If none of the parent or neighbor caches reply before this many
#	seconds (due to dropped packets or slow links), then the object
#	request will be satisfied from the default source.  The default
#	timeout is two seconds.
#
#neighbor_timeout 2

#  TAG: hierarchy_stoplist
#	A list of words which, if found in a URL, cause the object to
#	be handled directly by this cache.  In other words, use this
#	to not query neighbor caches for certain objects.  You may
#	list this option multiple times.
#
#	The default is to directly fetch URLs containing 'cgi-bin' or '?'.
#
hierarchy_stoplist cgi-bin ?

#  TAG: cache_stoplist
#	A list of words which, if found in a URL, cause the object to
#	immediately removed from the cache.  In other words, use this
#	to force certain objects to never be cached.  You may list this
#	option multiple times.
#
#	The default is to not cache URLs containing 'cgi-bin' or '?'.
#
cache_stoplist cgi-bin ?

#  TAG: cache_stoplist_pattern		# case sensitive
#  TAG: cache_stoplist_pattern/i	# case insensitive
#
#	Just like 'cache_stoplist' but you can use regular expressions
#	instead of simple string matching.  There is no default.
#
#cache_stoplist_pattern

# OPTIONS WHICH AFFECT THE CACHE SIZE
#-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

#
#  TAG: cache_mem (megabytes)
#	Maximum amout of VM used to store objects in memory.
#	This includes:
#		in-transit objects,
#		negative-cached objects,
#		"hot" objects
#	The value of cache_mem is an upper limit on the size of the
#	"in-memory object data" pool.  This is a pool of 4k pages used
#	to hold object data.
#
#	In-transit objects have priority over the others.  When
#	additional space is needed for incoming data, negative-cached
#	and hot objects will be released.  In other words, the
#	negative-cached and hot objects will fill up any unused space
#	not needed for in-transit objects.
#
#	The values of cache_mem_low and cache_mem_high (below) can be
#	used to tune the use of the memory pool.  When the high mark is
#	reached, in-transit and hot objects will be released to clear
#	space.  When an object transfer is completed, it will remain in
#	memory only if the current memory usage is below the low water
#	mark.
#
#	The default is 8 Megabytes.
#
#cache_mem  8

#  TAG: cache_swap (megabytes)
#	Maximum about of disk space used by the cache.  The default is
#	100 megabytes.  When the disk usage gets to this size, the cache
#	uses LRU replacement to evict objects as new objects are cached.
#	Note that cache_swap is set to:
#	        max(cache_mem, cache_swap_specified)
#	to guard against users' accidentally specifying a smaller
#	cache_swap than cache_mem size.
#	
#cache_swap 100

#  TAG: cache_swap_low  (percent, 0-100)
#  TAG: cache_swap_high (percent, 0-100)
#	The low- and high-water marks for cache LRU replacement.
#	LRU replacement begins when the high-water mark is reached
#	and ends when enough objects have been removed and the low-water
#	mark is reached. Defaults are 90% and 95%.
#	
#cache_swap_low  90
#cache_swap_high 95

#  TAG: cache_mem_low  (percent, 0-100)
#  TAG: cache_mem_high (percent, 0-100)
#	The low- and high-water mark for cache memory storage.  When
#	the amount of RAM used by the hot-object RAM cache reaches this
#	point, the cache starts throwing objects out of the RAM cache
#	(but they remain on disk).  Defaults are 75% and 90%.
#
#cache_mem_low  75
#cache_mem_high 90

#  TAG: maximum_object_size
#	Objects larger than this size will NOT be saved on disk.  The
#	value is specified in kilobytes, and the default is 4MB.
#
#maximum_object_size 4096

#  TAG: ipcache_size (number of entries)
#  TAG: ipcache_low  (percent)
#  TAG: ipcache_high (percent)
#	The size, low-, and high-water marks for the IP cache.
#
#ipcache_size 1024
#ipcache_low  90
#ipcache_high 95


# LOGFILE PATHNAMES AND CACHE DIRECTORIES

#  TAG: cache_dir
#	Directory for on-disk cache storage.  The cache will change into
#	this directory when running.  The default is

#
#	You can specify multiple cache_dir lines to spread the
#	cache among different disk partitions.

#cache_store_log @@DEFAULT_STORE_LOG@@

#  TAG:	cache_swap_log
#	Location for the cache "swap log."  This log file holds the
#	metadata of objects saved on disk.  It is used to rebuild the
#	cache during startup.  Normally this file resides in the first
#	'cache_dir' directory, but you may specify an alternate
#	pathname here.  Note you must give a full filename, not just
#	a directory.
#
#cache_swap_log

#  TAG: emulate_httpd_log
#	The Cache can emulate the log file format which many 'httpd'
#	programs use.  To disable/enable this emulation, set
#	emulate_httpd_log to 'off' or 'on'.  The default
#	is to use the native log format.
#
#emulate_httpd_log off

#  TAG: log_mime_hdrs
#	The Cache can record both the request and the response
#	MIME headers for each HTTP transaction.  The headers are
#	encoded safely and will appear as two bracketed fields
#	at the end of the access log (for either the native
#	or httpd-emulated log formats).  To enable this logging
#	set log_mime_hdrs to 'on'.
#
#	NOTE: support for this may require you to define
#	LOG_FULL_HEADERS before compiling.
#
#log_mime_hdrs off

#  TAG: useragent_log
#	If compiled with "-DUSE_USERAGENT_LOG=1" Squid will write
#	the User-Agent field from HTTP requests to the filename
#	specified here.  By default useragent_log is disabled.
#
#useragent_log none

#	levels for all sections.  We recommend normally running with
#	"ALL,1".
#
debug_options ALL,1

# OPTIONS FOR EXTERNAL SUPPORT PROGRAMS
#-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

#  TAG: ftpget_program
#	Where to find the 'ftpget' program that retrieves FTP data (HTTP
#	and Gopher protocol support are built into the cache).
#
#	To disable ftpget and the ability to retrieve FTP objects, set
#	this to "none".  Note that ftpget is automatically disabled for

#	
#	ftpget_options -n 60 -R -W
#
#ftpget_options

# If you want the anonymous login password to be more informative
# (and enable the use of picky ftp servers), set this to something
# resonable for your domain, like wwwuser@@somewhere.net
#
# The reason why this is domainless by default is that the
# request can be made on the behalf of a user in any domain,
# depending on how the cache is used.
# Some ftp server also validate that the email address is valid
# (for example perl.com).
#
#ftp_user squid@@

#  TAG: cache_dns_program
#	Specify the location of the executable for dnslookup process.
#
#cache_dns_program @@DEFAULT_DNSSERVER@@

#  TAG: dns_children
#	The number of processes spawn to service DNS name lookups.
#	For heavily loaded caches on large servers, you should
#	probably increase this value to at least 10.  The maximum
#	is 32.  The default is 5.
#
#	To disable dnsservers, set this to 0.  NOTE, this is very
#	strongly discouraged.  If you disable dnsservers your Squid
#	process will BLOCK on DNS lookups!
#
#dns_children 5

#  TAG: dns_defnames
#	Normally the 'dnsserver' disables the RES_DEFNAMES resolver
#	option (see res_init(3)).  This prevents caches in a hierarchy
#	from interpreting single-component hostnames locally.  To allow
#	dnsserver to handle single-component names, enable this
#	option.
#
#dns_defnames off

# OPTIONS FOR TUNING THE CACHE
#-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

#  TAG: wais_relay
#	Relay WAIS request to host (1st arg) at port (2 arg).
#
#wais_relay localhost 8000

#  TAG: request_size
#	Maximum allowed request size in kilobytes.  If people are using
#	POST to upload files, then set this to the largest acceptable
#	filesize plus a few extra kbytes.
#
#request_size 100

#  TAG: refresh_pattern		# case sensitive
#  TAG: refresh_pattern/i	# case insensitive
#
#	usage: refresh_pattern regex min percent max
#
#	min and max are specified in MINUTES.
#	percent is an integer number.
#
#	Please see the file doc/Release-Notes-1.1.txt for a full
#	description of Squid's refresh algorithm.  Basically a
#	cached object is:
#
#		FRESH if age < min
#		STALE if expires < now
#		STALE if age > max
#		FRESH if lm-factor < percent
#
#	The refresh_pattern lines are checked in the order listed here.
#	The first entry which matches is used.  If none of the entries
#	match, then the default will be used.
#
#Default:
#refresh_pattern 	.	0 20% 4320

#  TAG: reference_age
#	As a part of normal operation, Squid performs Least Recently
#	Used removal of cached objects.  The LRU age for removal is
#	computed dynamically, based on the amount of disk space in
#	use.  The 'reference_age' value defines the maximum LRU age.
#	For example, setting reference_age to '1 week' will cause
#	objects to be removed if they have not been accessed for a week
#	or more.  If set to zero, LRU removal is disabled, and objects
#	will be removed only when disk usage is over the high water
#	mark.  The default value is one year.
#
#	Specify a number here, followed by units of time.  For example:
#		1 week
#		3.5 days
#		4 months
#		2.2 hours
#
#reference_age 1 year

#  TAG: quick_abort
#	By default the cache continues to retrieve objects from
#	aborted requests.  This may be undesirable on slow (e.g. SLIP)
#	links and/or very busy caches.  Impatient users may tie up
#	file descriptors by repeatedly aborting and re-requesting
#	non-cachable objects.
#	
#	Usage: quick_abort    min-kbytes percent max-kbytes
#
#       When the user aborts a request, Squid will check the
#	quick_abort values to the amount of data transfered until
#	then.
#
#	If the transfer has less than 'min-kbytes' remaining, it
#	will finish the retrieval.  Setting minlength to -1 will
#	disable the quick_abort feature.
#
#	If the transfer has more than 'max-kbytes' remaining, it
#	will abort the retrieval.
#
#	If more than 'percent' of the transfer has completed, it will
#	finish the retrieval.
#
#quick_abort    -1 0 0

#  TAG: negative_ttl (minutes)
#	Time-to-Live (TTL) for failed requests.  Certain types of
#	failures (such as "connection refused" and "404 Not Found") are
#	negatively-cached for a small amount of time.  The default is 5
#	minutes.  Note that this is different from negative caching of
#	DNS lookups.
#
#negative_ttl 5

#
#  TAG: positive_dns_ttl (minutes)
#	Time-to-Live (TTL) for positive caching of successful DNS lookups.
#	Default is 6 hours (360 minutes).  If you want to minimize the
#	use of Squid's ipcache, set this to 1, not 0.
#
#positive_dns_ttl 360

#  TAG: negative_dns_ttl (minutes)
#	Time-to-Live (TTL) for negative caching of failed DNS lookups.
#
#negative_dns_ttl 5


# TIMEOUTS
#-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

#  TAG: connect_timeout (seconds)
#	Some systems (notably Linux) can not be relied upon to properly
#	time out connect(2) requests.  Therefore the squid process
#	enforces its own timeout on server connections.  This parameter
#	specifies how long to wait for the connect to complete.  The
#	default is two minutes (120 seconds).
#
#connect_timeout 120

#  TAG: read_timeout (minutes)
#	An active connection will be aborted after read_timeout minutes
#	of no activity on that connection (i.e., assume the remote server
#	or network connection died after the connection was established).
#	The default is 15 minutes.
#
#read_timeout 15

#  TAG: client_lifetime (minutes)
#	The maximum amount of time that a client (browser) is allowed to
#	remain connected to the cache process.  This protects the Cache
#	from having alot of sockets (and hence file descriptors) tied up
#	in a CLOSE_WAIT state from remote clients that go away without
#	properly shutting down (either because of a network failure or
#	because of a poor client implementation).  The default is three
#	hours, 20 minutes.
#
#	NOTE:  The default value is designed with low-speed client
#	connections in mind.  200 minutes should be plenty of time to
#	transfer a 10M file at 1k/sec.  If you have high-speed client
#	connectivity, or occasionally run out of file descriptors,
#	we suggest you lower this value appropriately.
#
#client_lifetime 200

#  TAG: shutdown_lifetime (seconds)
#
#	When SIGTERM or SIGHUP is received, the cache is put into
#	"shutdown pending" mode until all active sockets are closed.
#	This value is the lifetime to set for all open descriptors
#	during shutdown mode.  Any active clients after this many
#	seconds will receive a 'lifetime expire' message
#
#shutdown_lifetime 30

# Allowing or Denying access based on defined access lists
#
# Access to the HTTP port:
#     http_access allow|deny [!]aclname ...
#
# Access to the ICP port:
#     icp_access  allow|deny [!]aclname ...
#
# NOTE on default values:
#
#	If there are no "access" lines present, the default is to allow
#	the request.
#
#	If none of the "access" lines cause a match, the default is the
#	opposite of the last line in the list.  If the last line was
#	deny, then the default is allow.  Conversely, if the last line
#	is allow, the default will be deny.  For these reasons, it is a
#	good idea to have an "deny all" or "allow all" entry at the end
#	of your access lists to avoid potential confusion.


# Only allow access to the cache manager functions from the local host.
http_access deny manager !localhost
http_access deny CONNECT !SSL_ports
http_access deny Dangerous_ports

# Allow everything else
http_access allow  all

# Reply to all ICP queries we receive
icp_access  allow  all

#  TAG: miss_access
#       Use to force your neighbors to use you as a sibling instead of
#	a parent.  For example:
#
#		acl localclients src 172.16.0.0/16
#		miss_access allow localclients
#		miss_access deny  !localclients
#
#	This means that only your local clients are allowed to fetch
#	MISSES and all other clients can only fetch HITS.
#
#	By default, allow all clients who passed the http_access rules
#	to fetch MISSES from us.
#
miss_access allow  all

#  TAG: cache_host_acl
#	Just like 'cache_host_domain' but provides more flexibility by
#	using ACL's.
#
#		cache_host_acl cache-host	[!]aclname ...
#
#	NOTE:	* Any number of ACL's may be given for a cache-host,
#		  either on the same or separate lines.
#		* When multiple ACL's are given for a particular
#		  cache-host, the first matched ACL is applied.
#               * Cache hosts with no domain or ACL restrictions are
#		  queried for all requests.
#		* There are no defaults.


# ADMINISTRATIVE PARAMETERS
#-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

#  TAG: cache_mgr
#	Email-address of local cache manager who will receive
#	mail if the cache dies.  The default is "webmaster."
#
#cache_mgr webmaster

#  TAG: cache_effective_user
#	If the cache is run as root, it will change its effective/real
#	UID/GID to the UID/GID specified below.  The default is not to
#	change UID/GID.
#
#cache_effective_user nobody nogroup

#  TAG: visible_hostname
#	If you want to present a special hostname in error messages, etc,
#	then define this.  Otherwise, the return value of gethostname()
#	will be used.
#
#visible_hostname www-cache.foo.org


# OPTIONS FOR THE CACHE REGISTRATION SERVICE
#-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

#	This section contains parameters for the (optional) cache
#	announcement service.  This service is provided to help
#	cache administrators locate one another in order to join or
#	create cache hierarchies.
#
#	An 'announcement' message is sent (via UDP) to the registration
#	service by Squid.  By default, the annoucement message is NOT
#	SENT unless you enable it with 'cache_announce' below.
#
#	The announcement message includes your hostname, plus the
#	following information from this configuration file:
#
#		http_port
#		icp_port
#		cache_mgr
#
#	All current information is processed regularly and made
#	available on the Web at http://www.nlanr.net/Cache/Tracker/.


# This is how frequently to send cache announcements.  The default
# is `0' which disables sending the announcement messages.
#
# To enable announcing your cache, just uncomment the line below.
#
#cache_announce 24

# This is the hostname and portnumber where the registration message
# will be sent.
#
# Format:	announce_to   host[:port] [filename]
#
# Hostname will default to 'sd.cache.nlanr.net' and port will default
# to 3131.  If the 'filename' argument is given, the contents of that
# file will be included in the announce message.
#
#announce_to sd.cache.nlanr.net:3131


# HTTPD-ACCELERATOR OPTIONS
#-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

#  TAG: httpd_accel
#	If you want to run squid as an httpd accelerator, define the
#	host name and port number where the real HTTP server is.
#
#	If you want virtual host support then specify the hostname
#	as "virtual".
#
#httpd_accel real_httpd_host real_httpd_port

#  TAG: httpd_accel_with_proxy
#	If you want to use squid as both a local httpd accelerator
#	and as a proxy, change this to 'on'.
#
#httpd_accel_with_proxy off

#  TAG: httpd_accel_uses_host_header
#	HTTP/1.1 requests include a Host: header which is basically the
#	hostname from the URL.  Squid can be an accelerator for
#	different HTTP servers by looking at this header.  However,
#	Squid does NOT check the value of the Host header, so it opens
#	a big security hole.  We recommend that this option remain
#	disabled unless you are sure of what you are doing.
#
#httpd_accel_uses_host_header off


# MISCELLANEOUS
#-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

# The DNS tests exit as soon as the first site is successfully looked up
#
# If you want to disable DNS tests, do not comment out or delete this
# list.  Instead use the -D command line option
#
dns_testnames internic.net usc.edu cs.colorado.edu mit.edu yale.edu

#  TAG: logfile_rotate #
#	Specifies the number of logfile rotations to make upon receiving
#	a USR1 signal.  The default is 10, which will rotate with
#	extensions 0 through 9.  Setting logfile_rotate to 0 will
#	disable the rotation, but the logfiles are still closed and
#	re-opened.  This will enable you to rename the logfiles yourself
#	just before sending a USR1 signal to the squid process.
#
#logfile_rotate 10

#  TAG: append_domain
#	Appends local domain name to hostnames without any dots in them.
#	append_domain must begin with a period.
#
#append_domain .yourdomain.com

#  TAG: tcp_recv_bufsize
#	Size of receive buffer to set for TCP sockets.  Probably just
#	as easy to change your kernel's default.  Set to zero to use
#	the default buffer size.
#
#tcp_recv_bufsize 0


#  TAG: ssl_proxy
#	Specify the name of a 'cache_host' listed above, or a hostname
#	and port number where all SSL requests should be forwarded to.
#
#	Usage: ssl_proxy cache_host
#	       ssl_proxy host:port
#
#ssl_proxy

#  TAG: passthrough_proxy
#	Specify the name of a 'cache_host' listed above, or a hostname
#	and port number where all non-GET (i.e. POST, PUT) requests
#	should be forwarded to.
#
#	Usage: passthrough_proxy cache_host
#	       passthrough_proxy host:port
#
#passthrough_proxy

#  TAG: proxy_auth
#	Usage: proxy_auth passwd_file [ ignore-domain ]
#
#	'passwd_file' is an apache-style file of passwords for
#	authenticated proxy access Looks like user:password, with the
#	password being standard crypt() format.  Proxy authentication
#	is disabled by default.
#
#	'ignore-domain' is a domain name for which authorization will
#	*not* be required.
#
#	NOTE, proxy_auth support is not compiled into Squid by default.
#	To use this feature you must enable the USE_PROXY_AUTH option
#	near the top of src/Makefile.
#
#proxy_auth /dev/null

#  TAG: err_html_text
#	HTML text to include in error messages.  Make this a "mailto"
#	URL to your admin address, or maybe just a link to your
#	organizations Web page.
#
#err_html_text

#  TAG: deny_info
#	Usage: deny_info URL acl
#
#	This can be used to return a HTTP redirect for requests which
#	do not pass the 'http_access' rules.  A single ACL will cause
#	the http_access check to fail.  If a 'deny_info' line exists
#	for that ACL then Squid returns a redirect to the given URL.

#  TAG: udp_hit_obj on|off
#	If set, Squid will request UDP_HIT_OBJ replies from its
#	neighbors.  UDP_HIT_OBJ is nice because it saves bandwidth, but
#	it can cause some other problems.  For one it complicates
#	calculating hit rates.  Also, problems arise because the ICP
#	query does not contain any HTTP request headers which may
#	affect the reply.
#
#udp_hit_obj off

#  TAG: udp_hit_obj_size
#
#     If set, Squid will limit UDP_HIT_OBJ size to be less than
#     this value.  Setting this value to more than SQUID_UDP_SO_SNDBUF
#     will not work as expected.  Set to zero to select the size
#     permited by the socket.
#udp_hit_obj_size     0

#  TAG: memory_pools on|off
#	If set, Squid will keep pools of allocated (but unused) memory
#	available for future use.  If memory is a premium on your
#	system, disable this.
#
#memory_pools on

#  TAG: forwarded_for on|off
#	If set, Squid will include your system's IP address or name
#	in the HTTP requests it forwards.  By default it looks like
#	this:
#
#		X-Forwarded-For: 192.1.2.3
#
#	If you disable this, it will appear as
#
#		X-Forwarded-For: unknown
#
#forwarded_for on

#  TAG:	log_icp_queries on|off
#	If set, ICP queries are logged to access.log.  ICP logging
#	is enabled by default, so uncomment and change the line
#	below to disable it.
#
#log_icp_queries on


#  TAG: minimum_direct_hops
#	If using the ICMP pinging stuff, do direct fetches for sites
#	which are no more than this many hops away.
#
minimum_direct_hops 4

#  TAG: cachemgr_passwd
#       Specify passwords for cachemgr operations.
#
#Usage: cachemgr_passwd password action action ...
#
#	valid actions are:
#		shutdown *
#		info
#		stats/objects
#		stats/vm_objects
#		stats/utilization
#		stats/ipcache
#		stats/fqdncache
#		stats/dns
#		stats/redirector
#		stats/io
#		stats/reply_headers
#		stats/filedescriptors
#		stats/netdb
#		log/status *
#		log/enable *
#		log/disable *
#		log/clear *
#		log *
#		parameter
#		server_list
#		client_list
#		squid.conf *
#
#	* Indicates actions which will not be performed without a
#	  valid password, others can be performed if not listed here.
#
#	To disable an action, set the password to "disable".
#       To allow performing an action without a password, set the
#	password to "none".
#
#	Use the keyword "all" to set the same password for all actions.
#
#Examples:
#
#	cachemgr_passwd secret shutdown
#	cachemgr_passwd lesssssssecret info stats/objects
#	cachemgr_passwd disable all
#
#Defaults: none

#  TAG: swap_level1_dirs
#	Number of first-level directories to create for storing cached
#	objects.  Minimum 1, maximum 256, default 16.
#
#swap_level1_dirs 16

#  TAG: swap_level2_dirs
#       Number of sub-directories to create under each first-level
#	directory.  Minimum 1, maximum 256, default 256.
#
#swap_level2_dirs 256

#  TAG: store_avg_object_size
#	Average object size, used to estimate number of objects your
#	cache can hold.  See doc/Release-Notes-1.1.txt.  The default is
#	20K.
#
#store_avg_object_size 20

#  TAG: store_objects_per_bucket
#	Target number of objects per bucket in the store hash table.
#	Lowering this value increases the total number of buckets and
#	also the storage maintenance rate.  The default is 20.
#
#store_objects_per_bucket 20

#  TAG: http_anonymizer
#	If you want to filter out certain HTTP request headers for
#	privacy reasons, enable this option.  There are three
#	appropriate settings:
#		'off'		All HTTP request headers are passed.
#		'standard'	Specific headers are removed
#		'paranoid'	Only specific headers are allowed.
#	To see which headers are allowed or denied, please see the
#	http-anon.c source file.
#
#http_anonymizer off

#  TAG: client_db
#	If you want to disable collecting per-client statistics, then
#	turn off client_db here.
#
#client_db on

#  TAG: netdb_low
#  TAG: netdb_high
#	The low and high water marks for the ICMP measurement
#	database.  These are counts, not percents.  The defaults are
#	900 and 1000.  When the high water mark is reached, database
#	entries will be deleted until the low mark is reached.
#
#netdb_low 900
#netdb_high 1000

#  TAG: netdb_ping_rate
#	The minimum period for measuring a site.  There will be at
#	least this much delay between successive pings to the same
#	network.  The default is five minutes.
#
#netdb_ping_period 5 minutes

#  TAG: query_icmp
#	If you want to ask your peers to include ICMP data in their ICP
#	replies, enable this option.
#
#	If your peer has built squid with '-DUSE_ICMP=1' then that peer
#	will send ICMP pings to origin server sites of the URLs it
#	receives.  If you enable this option then the ICP replies from
#	that peer will include the ICMP data (if available).  Then,
#	when choosing a parent cache, Squid will choose the parent with
#	the minimal RTT to the origin server.  When this happens, the
#	hierarchy field of the access.log will be
#	"CLOSEST_PARENT_MISS".  This option is off by default.
#
#query_icmp off

#  TAG: icp_hit_stale
#	If you want to return ICP_HIT for stale cache objects, set this
#	option to 'on'.  If you have sibling relationships with caches
#	in other administrative domains, this should be 'off'.  If you only
#	have sibling relationships with caches under your control, then
#	it is probably okay to set this to 'on'.
#
#icp_hit_stale off
