<title>GloMop Meeting Minutes</title>

<body>
<font size=+3>Meeting on 01/30/96:
<font size=+0>

<!--------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<hr><h2><a name=agenda>Agenda</a></h2>

<ul>
  <li>"Big picture" document vs. PDA scenario?
       <p> The handoff stuff is probably (initially) not needed for
       PDA's.  We then get the "little picture" where only the app and
       GloMop run on client.</p>

  <li> "Big picture" vs. Web proxy: see the discussion of
       <a href=../plans.html#pythia>"Double proxy"</a>.

  <li> API implementation
       <p>Minimally need specification of proxy side architectural
       blocks, bytestream protocol for GET, and bytestream protocol for
       control/errors.</p>
       <ul>
         <li> <b>AR (Armando):</b> Proxy-side arch doc by Friday 1PM.
         <li> <b>AR (Steve):</b> Outstanding bytestream specs by Monday
              meeting.
       </ul>
  <li> Proxy will be Perl for now.
       In deciding when/whether to move to C:
       <ol>
         <li> Performance: what is "raw perf hit" of Perl vs. C?
              <b>AR (Armando):</b> find perf studies on net.
         <li> NOW/AM in Perl: does this make sense?  We'll see
              how it fits into proxy-side arch. picture before
              discussing.
         <li> Benefits of threaded proxy.  Armando's hypothesis:
              control part of proxy is not CPU-intensive, so
              benefit from threads not clear; for TSM's, threads
              are fine for a single machine, but farming them out
              to other workstations obviates threading.  The
              issue then becomes how to communicate with them
              (AM?)
       </ol>
  <li> Client side for Tk
       <p>Steve will write this using Tk event dispatcher for
       callbacks.  This shouldn't take long.  When done, will start
       Magic Cap implementation.
       <ul><li><b>AR (Steve):</b> Tk client timeline by Monday meeting.</ul>
  <li> Driving apps
       <p> For Doug Terry's class, we'll be developing
       <a href=../plans.html#wb>proxied WB for PDA's.</a>
       Would be a good driving app (and ILP demo?)</p>
</ul>


<!--------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<hr><h2><a name=agenda>Other Items</a></h2>

<ul>
  <li> ILP talks: need handouts etc. soon.  Revise retreat talk?
  <li> ILP demos: also to discuss w/Daedalus on Friday.
  <li> Is Ali still working on this?  If so must talk to him after proxy
       arch. doc is ready.
  <li> We need a reading group...
</ul>
