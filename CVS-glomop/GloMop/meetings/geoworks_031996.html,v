<h1>Executive summary</h1>

<i>GeoWorks' wish list for value-added distillation services as application
enablers for PDA's is a proper subset of our own list.</i>
</p>

Jonathan gave a high-level description
of Geoworks' company strategy for the next year or two, and of the
technical assets of  Geos that will help them 
realize it.  In a nutshell, Geoworks wants to focus on PDA class
devices and smart cellphones like the new Nokia 9000, and they
understand that connectivity to the Internet and integration with the
desktop is the key to large scale acceptance, and that distillation is
one of the keys that makes WWW and email possible for these devices.  To
that end, they want to cooperate with us to develop an
implementation of the proxy/distillation technology for deployment
with the aid of an unnamed cellular service provider in Europe who has
already expressed concrete interest in deploying this as a value-added
service to O(100,000) cel phone users.

<H3>Their view of proxy/distillation services</H3>

Jonathan believes (I disagree) that eventually a separate-but-compatible
"mobile web" 
will emerge that has content specifically targeted to PDA users, and 
interestingly Nokia has
already put up a number of web pages for users of their smart cell phone
(which we got to see--more on that later), where the pages have been
formatted to the exact screen size of the device with 2-bit grayscale.
The device's browser understand HTML/HTTP and in fact everything from
a Winsock-like sockets interface down to the hardware driver level are
Geos modules, so the browser must have been easy to do.

<p>Their belief in the "mobile web" causes them to see distillation,
especially HTML 
reformatting/conversion, as a stopgap measure to let PDA users browse
existing content until the Mobile Web is in place.

<h3>Implementation</h3>

<p>Louis Lao's  list of requirements should look familiar:

<OL>
  <LI> distillation of graphics
  <LI> distillation of text (e.g. tokenized HTML, or constructing
       piecewise small HTML pages from one big one)
  <LI> customizable for targeted device screen
  <LI> customizable via user preferences, but he emphasized they want a
       <i>simple</i> interface.  Our interface already has too many
       knobs, by that metric.
  <LI> refinement
  <li> extensibility: can add distillation of new datatypes without
       changing installed customer or proxy core SW
  <li> scalable to O(100,000) smart cel phone users (see below)
</OL>

Non-requirements (for now):
<ol>
  <li> Dynamic adaptation, given the tigher bounds on bandwidth
       variation in cellular world
  <li> Custom protocol and markup (other than HTTP/HTML): they understand
       the efficiency arguments, but want to make sure a user can always
       browse the Web "raw", since the proxy's ability to make pages look good
       does have its limits. (I pointed out the obvious argument, but
       they seemed insistent.)  
  <li> For future reference, they were intrigued at the idea of turning on
       multiple NI's to increase bandwidth.  E.g. the Nokia 9000 has both IRDA
       and cellular modem built in.
</ol>
<P>

<p>Somewhat paradoxically, Wink communications (a Geoworks spinoff; we
talked to Pat Ransil during ILP) has a lightweight,
scripted protocol called ICAP that, as far as I could make out, is their
version of lightweight Java.  It is designed for things like putting up
simple menus and dialogs for interactive set top boxes.

<p>
The other app of interest is email, and Louis would like to see (Friday)
a demo of Magic Link MIME email.  Geos has an application-level email
interface that can receive "smart mail" (i.e. someone can mail you a
calendar appointment and Geos will add it to your calendar).  I
explained how transcoding can do this for non-Geos-originated mail and
they were pretty pleased at the possibilities.

<H3>Opportunity Knocks...</H3>

GeoWorks has  been talking with a cellular service
provider in Europe that is definitely interested in deploying
distillation services for web  (and email?) access.  The initial
customer base is O(100,000) cellular users.
This is a fantastic opportunity to have lots of users banging on a real
proxy in a real environment.  Their 
timeline is aggressive--development and deployment over next 6 months,
which matches our schedule and creates a nice summer
opportunity as well.

<P>
They indicated that they would be willing to work closely with us in
developing the technology for such a system, potentially giving us
equipment, technical support and documentation, SDKs, and engineer cycles.

<P>
And, for anybody interested, Geoworks is hiring.
