<title>GloMop: Week of 6/24</title>
</head>
<body>

<h2>Progress</h2>
<ul>
  <li> Extensive documentation (embedded pod) added to gmproxyd.
  <li> Great <a href="wink_062196.html">meeting with Wink</a> on 6/21 to
       discuss HTML/ICAP, hooking modular proxy to Wink servers,
       converging ICAP 2.0 and GloMop Lite, and consulting arrangements.
  <li> My plan for making a nonblocking UserAgent is in the <a
       href="file:/usr/tmp/fox/gmproxyd/TBD">TBD file</a>.  (If this
       link doesn't work, checkout the gmproxyd module from the
       repository to see the file.)
</ul>

<hr><h2>Critical path</h2>

<ul>
  <li> Threaded I/O abstraction: try to subclass LWP::UserAgent to add
       asynchronous methods to it (open since last week)
  <li> Production Pythia, for on-the-spot demos and software
       distribution to partners
</ul>

<hr><h2>Short term plans</h2>

<ul>
  <li> gmmon interface: need reliable datagrams, and publish the
       interface and/or a package for NCM and PTM to talk to it
  <li> Hire Lisa to make our WWW pages look good.  Also we need an
       official GloMop icon.  ("Yes...it runs with GloMop")       
</ul>
