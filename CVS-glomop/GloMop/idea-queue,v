@For 8/28 meeting:

- Need type registration.  TYPES field in request overrides (or
  augments?) type registration. 

- Consider separating transport from type protocol.  Proxy determines
  type and calls appropriate TSM (consistent with client's type list).

- Need modules that can perform the appropriate transfers (and do type
  determination; i.e. what type is an FTP-retrieved file?)  These
  modules must have a notion of priority.  

- should req id mappings be preserved across connections (per user)?  i
  think yes, to enable agents and very-low-priority doc requests (a
  trivial agent).

- TSM's should not have to know the bytestream protocol.  (to what
  extent do they know it now?)

- Proxy must still implement Incomplete call for uploads.

- extend HTTP proxy?  forms support for proxy options?  may give us
  insight into whether we can use httpd as proxy framework.
  

USABILITY ENHANCEMENTS FOR MAILER:

- does synchronization work as is?

- id/authentication  

From 8/18 meeting:

- fax back is now close to a reality: include return-path in API, or
  have a separate TSM that redirects documents? (e.g. show a thumbnail and
  popup list of options)

- tcl implementation of API

- notification

8/21:

- gif distillation proxy is adding real value - not just scaling.  the
  resulting images are *clearer* due to image processing (correct
  colormapping, etc.)

- we have "user testimonials" from using the WWW distiller.  we should
  patent it & talk to AOL.

- doc locator QOS prefs should include a notion of priority, ranging
  from "i want it right now" (HTML inline) to "whenever" (FTP to a crowded
  site; FTP module should know to retry infinite times for a low-pri
  request, rather than return an error).
