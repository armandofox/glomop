<h1>Intro Mini-Quiz!</h1>

Don't worry -- this is for your amusement only -- your score will have
absolutely no bearing on your grade.  <p>

But we hope you'll learn something interesting by looking back at your
responses as the semester progresses!<p>

<h2>Here we go...</h2>

For each invention below, fill in the name of the organization (company,
school, or whatever) or individuals (scientists, inventors, students,
hackers, whoever) that you would credit with the invention.  You can, if
you like, also try to guess at the date.<br>

<ol>
  <li> The modern automobile
<!--  it isn't Henry Ford... -->
  <li> The integrated circuit (IC) chip
<!--  Fairchild Semiconductor or TI (not Intel) -->
  <li> The first modern personal computer
<!--  Altair 8800 (not Apple II) -->
  <li> The first computer with the "mouse and windows" interface
<!--  Xerox Alto (not Macintosh or Lisa) -->
  <li> The World Wide Web
<!--  CERN and Tim B.L. (not NCSA or Netscape) -->
  <li> PostScript printers
<!--  Xerox PARC (not Adobe) -->
  <li> Electronic Spreadsheet programs
<!-- Bricklin and Frankston, VisiCalc -->       
</ol>

For each wrong answer, compare it to the correct answer.  Can you detect
any pattern in the correspondence between your answer and the correct
answer?

Idea: the originators of the idea (or even of the first implementation)
are often not the ones credited with it, because they did not go the
extra step to achieve widespread impact through the aggressive
realization of their idea for the "masses".

Message: the history of computing is not just about the history of
technology: it's also about the history of entrepreneurship, ego wars,
and the need to have someone else see their stuff and say "Cool!"
(Compare Cringely "impressing their friends")
