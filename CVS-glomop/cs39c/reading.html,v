<h1>List of possible sources for readings</h1>

<h3>Classic Monographs in Computer Science</h3>
<dl>
  <dt> George Boole, <i>An Investigation of the Laws of Thought</i></dt>
  <dd> The classic paper introducing the laws of Boolean algebra.  The
       correspondence between Boolean algebra and binary numbers 
       makes binary digital computers possible.
</dl>

<h3>History of Computing--General Overviews</h3>
<dl>
  <dt> Joel Shurkin, <i>Engines of the Mind</i>
  <dd> An excellent general overview of the history of computers from
       earliest times, up through the late 1970's, with detailed
       accounts of the life and times of Babbage, Hollerith, Von
       Neumann, Eckert and Mauchly, and other key players.
</dl>

<h3>Specific Developments in the History of Computing</h3>
<dl>
  <dt> Steven Levy, <i>Insanely Great: The Life and Times of Macintosh,
       the Computer That Changed Everything</i>
  <dd> A great overview of how Steve Jobs's vision for the Macintosh,
       based on the Xerox Alto,
       changed the way people thought about computers, and why the idea
       "made a dent in the universe".

  <li> Robert X. Cringely, <i>Accidental Empires: How the Boys of
       Silicon Valley Make Millions, Battle Foreign Competition, and
       Still Can't Get a Date.</i>  Also see the three-part video
       miniseries, <i>Triumph of the Nerds</i>, based on the book and
       narrated by the author.
</ul>

<h3>History of Communications Infrastructures</h3>

<ul>
  <li> Arthur C. Clarke, 1946 paper on communication satellite concept
</ul>

<h3>Computing and Communication Technology and Society</h3>
