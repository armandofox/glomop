@First lecture

Overview question: "what is a computer"

Visual aids: slide rule, grocery calc, abacus, sliding pebbles, sign
"Computer" for a person

Projects: radix-based vs symbolic numeration; do addition/multiplication in
roman numerals, decimal, binary; ==> radix vs non-radix systems  (idea:
pick a driving application, e.g. tax form, barter transaction, etc)

Message: commerce drove up volume and sophistication of transactions. 
         --> dark ages to renaissance: invention of logs & mech. calculators
         --> 50s-60s: large US companies using electronic computers

Message: military needs soaked up computrons
         --> babbage: ballistic trajectory calculation
         --> ENIAC: ballistic trajectory calculation
