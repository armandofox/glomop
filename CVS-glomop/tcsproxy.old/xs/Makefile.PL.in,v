@kwhilite* files modified for in-class examples. Distill() functionality
in clib.xs still not quite working - this commit will allow me to move
it to purify.  Added stuff to perl_stub makefile so that libperl.so's
directory is added to runtime dynamic lib path.

@evil bug in parse_status_and_headers was overwriting caller stack and
causing coredumps....we flushed it out of hiding by forcing everything
to bypass.  still need to test steve's changes and retrofit the new
mechanism for dealing with push.jpg.

log
@Changed the enum in clib.h to a series of #defines, so that the perl
extension builder automatically makes the values available to perl.
Much work on the perl html munger (using the new lexer): <img> attribute
GMMAGIC is now converted to URL magic in the SRC attribute by the
munger.  MonitorClient_Send and GetOptions are now available to perl
distillers; this required changes to perl_stub and clib.xs.  Bug fix to
tag_from_attribs routine in TACCutils.pm.  Tcl/tk simulator now supports
"reload" and "open", and canvas is resized correctly.  Perl harness now
turns on  perl -w by default.
