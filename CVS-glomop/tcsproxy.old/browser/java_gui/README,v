@new java files to make the java gui work with transend.cs as the server; these files also have more thorough documentation.

@*** gui.java ***

Things to do:

	- Check the CODEBASE in ICON_STRING.  We weren't sure where the
	applet would reside.

	- Make sure the dashboard is not hidden when the proxy is disabled.

	- Make sure the GetPrefs.html page is not cached.

	- Make sure the icons are cached.

Things to change for modifications:

	If this changes:			Change these fields:
	----------------			--------------------

	proxy location 				proxyHost
						HOST (in config_tr.h.in)
						
	number of panels			height
						minwidth
						numPanels
						numButtons
						initialization*

	size of dashboard			height
						minwidth
						initialization*	
	
	panel gif name				initialization of panels
						array elements in init()

	link					initialization of buttons
						array elements in init()


* Changing the initialization of panels and buttons is not as straight-
forward as changing other state variables.  The two arrays "panels" and
"buttons" are initialized in the init() function.  This section was
designed to make it fairly painless to add or change panels.  For 
example, the initialization tasks for each panel are grouped together.
One can change the order of panels by swapping two of these groups;
one can add a panel by adding one of these groups; etc. Note that if
one changes the width of a panel, the change will have to be made here
as well in the initialization of the widths array.
