JavaScript (especially ill-formed, illegal JavaScript) sometimes confuses
our HTML lexical analyzer, causing the JavaScript to be corrupted and your
browser to complain.  (But why do you have JavaScript turned on?  It's
insecure.  Maybe this is really a feature and we're just not telling you.)

Your browser's client-side cache may be polluted with distilled
representations of images.  This will only affect you if you stop surfing
the web through the proxy; if you notice cache pollution (some images won't
load, others load in degraded form) then flush your browser's main memory
and disk cache.

a partitioned web cache;  URLs that point to the same site but differ in
any way may be routed through different cache partitions, changing the IP
address from which the request appears to come.
