</TD></TR><TD WIDTH=100% ALIGN=left>

<H3>Enabling the TranSend Proxy:</H3>
In order to begin surfing the web through the TranSend proxy, you must do
the following (assuming you're using a Netscape Navigator browser):
<UL>
     <LI> Select <b>Network Preferences</b> from the <b>Options</b> menu.
	  <P>
     <LI> Click on the <b>Proxies</b> pane.
	  <P>
     <LI> If your browser supports Automatic Proxy Configuration,
	  select <B>Automatic Proxy Configuration</B>, type in the URL
	  &quot;http://transend.CS.Berkeley.EDU/proxy_cfg.pac&quot;, and
	  press the <B>Reload</B> button.
	  <P>
	  otherwise,
	  <P>
	  if your browser does not support Automatic Proxy Configuration,
	  select <B>Manual Proxy Configuration</B> and press the
	  <B>View..</B> button.  Type in &quot;transend.CS.Berkeley.EDU&quot;
	  for the <B>HTTP Proxy:</b> field, and &quot;4444&quot; for the
	  HTTP Proxy <B>Port:</B> field.
	  <P>
     <LI> Click OK and begin surfing!
</UL><P>
</TD></TR><TD WIDTH=100% ALIGN=left>

<H3>Disabling the TranSend Proxy:</H3>
In order to permanently disable the TranSend proxy, do the following:
<UL>
     <LI> Select <b>Network Preferences</b> from the <b>Options</b> menu.
	  <p>
     <LI> Click on the <b>Proxies</b> pane.
	  <P>
     <li> Select <B>No Proxies</B>.
	  <P>
     <li> Select the <B>Cache</b> pane.

	  Disk Cache Now</b>.
	  <P>

a similar manner by selecting <B>Preferences</b> under the <b>Edit</b>
menu, expanding the <b>Advanced</B> bullet, and selecting <b>Proxies</b>.
<P>
In order to disable distillation (but still get the benefits of the web
cache at our proxy), go to the
<a href="http://transend.cs.berkeley.edu/prefs.html">preferences page</a>,
deselect the <B>Enable Proxy</B> check box, and then press the
<B>Submit Preferences</B> button.

<H3>TranSend Proxy Overview:</H3>
When you are browsing using the TranSend proxy, you will notice
several changes.  A description of these changes is provided below:<P>

<STRONG>Distilled Images:</STRONG>  The proxy distills an image by
reducing its quality.  Although all images you see will be degraded,
you have the option of seeing the original image (See Refining Images
below).  For images that are links, you will also notice a little
symbol placed next to the image; this symbol is a link to the original
image.<P>

<STRONG>Faster Loading:</STRONG>  The result of using the TranSend
Proxy to distill images is faster web browsing.  You will see a
significant improvement in loading speed for web pages that have
images.<P>

<STRONG>TranSend Logo:</STRONG>  The TranSend logo will appear on all
web pages that you visit.  This logo will be located in the
upper-right-hand corner of the page and is a link to the TranSend Proxy
Settings page.  Clicking on the logo will take you to the page where
you can set personal proxy preferences. 
</TD></TR><TD WIDTH=100% ALIGN=left>

<H3>Refining Images:</H3>
When using the proxy, the images you see may not be of their highest
quality.  However, if you would like to view a certain image in its
original, undegraded form, you can refine the image.  To do this,
click on the image, or if the image is a link, click on the symbol next
to the image.  
</TD></TR><TD WIDTH=100% ALIGN=left>

<H3>Setting Personal Preferences:</H3>
To go to the settings page, click on the TranSend logo located at the
upper-left-hand corner of each page you visit.  Once you arrive at the
settings page, you can set the following preferences:

<UL>
  <LI>Enable Proxy
  <LI>Image Quality vs. Loading Speed
  <LI>Display Logo
</UL>

A description of each of these preferences is provided below:<P>

<STRONG>Enable Proxy Setting:</STRONG>  This setting allows you to turn
the proxy on and off.  For faster web browsing, it is recommended that
you keep this setting on.<P>

<STRONG>Image Quality vs. Loading Speed Setting:</STRONG>  This
setting allows you to select the level of quality for your
images. However, to obtain faster loading speeds, some image quality
must be sacrificed. <P>

<STRONG>Display Logo Setting:</STRONG>  This setting allows you to
choose whether you want the TranSend logo to appear on the top of each
web page.  For easy access to the settings page, it is recommended
that you keep this setting on.
If you have disabled the logo, the preferences page can be found at
<a href="http://transend.cs.berkeley.edu/prefs.html">http://transend.cs.berkeley.edu/prefs.html</a>.<P>

After you have entered your preferences, click on the "Submit
preferences" button and your  preferences will begin taking effect.
Also, if you want to reset your settings to their previous values,
click on the "Reset to previous settings" button.
</TD></TR><TD WIDTH=100% ALIGN=left>

<H3>Reporting Bugs:</H3>
To report bugs or send comments, go to the settings page by clicking
on the TranSend logo.  At the bottom of the settings page, you will
find a section to mail comments.  Type in your email address, subject,
and any comments you have.  Then click on the "Mail comments" button
to send your message.   We have a list of known bugs
<a href="bugs.html">here</A>.

@Many changes to support SDK, including bin and sbin directories,
and modified make targets and names of some binary targets.  Calling
convention changed for perl distillers, so fixed html distiller and
added it as transend.text.html.  monitor.multicast property is now
Monitor.listen; all relevant code was changed.  Monitor can now parse
this from the options file.  Updated all UI changes from branch head.
