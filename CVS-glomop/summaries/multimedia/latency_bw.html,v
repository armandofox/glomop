<hr><a name=content><h2>Content Summary</h2>



Because of the speed-of-light limitation, gigabit networks have a behavior 
that is <i>qualitatively</i> as well as quantitatively different from that of 
slower networks.  Queueing theory is used to derive the "critical curve" for 
channel capacity delineating operating regions in which a network is 
bandwidth-limited from regions in which it is latency-limited, given a 
particular network load.  Also, because of the large capacity of long-haul 
gigabit networks, congestion control is not enough; end-to-end flow control 
must be used to control the backup of bits in the pipe.  The paper also 
claims that statistical effects can be used to handle a large number of 
bursty sources in order to improve overall efficiency, but a recent paper 
<i>On the Self-Similarity of Ethernet Traffic</i> suggests that this 
conclusion may be based on an assumption that is not borne out by measurement 
of traffic patterns.





<hr><a name=relevance><h2>Relevance to Multimedia</h2>



Multimedia relies on high-bandwidth networks and can benefit from gigabit 
capacities, but until recently low latency has been taken for granted.  The 
real-time nature of many multimedia applications, especially collaborative 
apps, requires us to reexamine our operating assumptions.

3 out of 5: sort of an obvious issue, but a good exposition.
