<hr><a name=content><h2>Content Summary</h2>



ATM was designed to be cost effective, scalable, compatible with existing 
networks at all scales, and easily implement multicast.  Virtual-channel and 
virtual-path mechanisms are used for routing and to multiplex multiple paths 
into a single logical channel if desired; the VPI and VCI routing protocols 
are lightweight since they must be handled in hardware, and due to the high 
bandwidth of optical media the switch latency is now in the critical path.  
The values chosen for various parameters (bandwidths, cell sizes, etc.) often 
represented compromises between the US and European groups, both of whom 
wanted to retain compatibility with existing infrastructures.

</p>

<p>

The ATM reference model contains the adaptataion layer (AAL), which provides 
network models (connection-oriented, connectionless, time priorities or not); 
the ATM layer, which mostly does routing and control signalling; and the 
physical layer, which defines signal levels on various transmission media, 
etc.  The two most widely accepted physical standards are currently SONET and 
HDS.

</p>

<p>

Remaining challenges for ATM include good emulation of existing LAN standards 
(e.g. IEEE 802.x), hardware incompatibilities among vendors, QOS scheduling 
in software (ATM provides the mechanism for doing this but no policy), 
creating fast switches, and implementing successful flow and congestion 
control.

</p>



<hr><a name=relevance><h2>Relevance to Multimedia</h2>

Lest ATM and optical networks be viewed as a magical cure-all for bandwidth-
limited applications or software requiring hard QOS guarantees, this article 
highlights some of the challenges and difficulties that will accompany the 
transition, and presents some guidance to the maze of standards and protocols 
that the term "ATM" currently comprises.

4 out of 5: lots of useful tables and a good discussion of the real-life 
challenges faced by ATM.
