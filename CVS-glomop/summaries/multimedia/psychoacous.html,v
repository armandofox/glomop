<hr><h2>Content Summary</h2>

Psychoacoustics plays an important role in digital audio compression by
exploiting "reduction of irrelevance": compressing out parts of the
signal that are imperceptible to human ears.  For example, the MUSICAM
system passes uses a set of bandpass filters to confine quantization
noise within each subband, and dynamically allocates bits to each
subband as follows: If subband energy falls below the psychoacoustic
"masking threshold", that part of the signal receives zero bits,
otherwise it gets just enough bits to keep the quantization noise in the
subband just below the psychoacoustic audible threshold.  This technique
is used to encode audio into a 353Kbit/sec stream that 75% of
psychometric test subjects cannot distinguish from true CD quality.

<hr><h2>Relevance to Multimedia</h2>

Given the limited effective bandwidth (relative to demands of CD-quality
audio) of today's communication systems, techniques for real-time audio
compression are acutely relevant if multimedia networks are to become
widespread. 

<hr><h2>Rating</h2>

5 out of 5.  Real engineering benefits were realized from exploiting
psychoacoustic properties of human hearing, without appreciable
reduction in perceived sound quality.
