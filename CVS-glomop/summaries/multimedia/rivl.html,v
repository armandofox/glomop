<h1>Creatures of Habit: A Field Guide to Video Software Codecs</h1>

<hr><a name=content><h2>Content Summary</h2>

A lightweight summary of commodity, commercially-available video codecs,
ranging from realtime encoding (Intel Indeo) to way-slow (fractal-based
SoftVideo).  Emphasis is on "mundane" properties such as vendor support,
OS compatibility, the future of the company, etc. rather than technical
merit of each approach.  A few hints are given on how to choose a system
based on some high-level criteria (source video content, whether you
need fast compression, etc.)

<hr><a name=relevance><h2>Relevance to Multimedia</h2>

Probably relevant if you're buying a system, but even in such a case I'd
want a lot more technical detail than what this article offers.

1 out of 5: not much content here.  A single table would have been
sufficient to present all of this information.

<h1>RIVL: A Resolution-Independent Video Language</h1>

<hr><a name=content2><h2>Content Summary</h2>

Description of a "language" (really just a set of primitive operations)
for describing various transformations on video (overlay, fade,
rotate/translate, convolve, crop, cut clip, etc.), and examples of how
these primitives can be used to create some standard video effects.  The
Source video properties such as encoding format, resolution, timecode
system, etc. are abstracted away by the language.  IMHO calling this a
"language" is generous, but the idea of distilling some primitive
operations on video objects and providing them in a
resolution-independent way is sound.

<hr><a name=relevance2><h2>Relevance to Multimedia</h2>

Potentially a great platform for prototyping video editors; has the
potential to do for video some of what Tk has done for GUI's, i.e. make
high-level abstractions so easy to use that integrating video into
applications will be trivial.  However, like Tk, there is no concern for
code compactness or performance.

4 out of 5: this is a "why hasn't someone thought of this before" paper.
