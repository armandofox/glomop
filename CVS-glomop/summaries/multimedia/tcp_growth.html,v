<hr><a name=content><h2>Content Summary</h2>



The paper summarizes observed growth trends with data points taken over a 3-
year period of TCP traffic in and out of LBL.  A few interesting rules of 
thumb emerge from the analysis:

<ul>

<li>Network use grows exponentially until the capacity is saturated.  This 
was true even in the bad old days of low-bandwidth networks and relatively 
few users, and is more true than ever given the WWW.  <b>Armando's 
corollary:</b> Design your network for steady-state saturated operation.

<li>Accounting is difficult.  The authors worked hard to eliminate "spurious" 
traffic, such as anomalous scripts, heavy traffic between a particular pair 
of nodes due to node-specific activity, TCP packets that claimed infeasible 
data payload sizes, etc.  <b>Armando's corollary:</b> It's hard to regulate 
this kind of use as well, and there's nothing to stop me from flooding my 
subnet with packets, the effects of which could propagate to faraway places 
on the Internet.

<li>A small number of hosts/sites account for a large percentage of the 
traffic.  This is Amdahl's Law applied to network traffic and is not 
surprising, but it's good to see it supported by numbers.

<li>The WWW is the killer app for the high-speed connected Internet, just as 
email and news were the killer apps for their audience in their day.  
<b>Armando's corollary:</b> New apps will arise that soak up bandwidth as 
fast as badnwidth can be added.  This is also true of software and CPU's.

</ul>





<hr><a name=relevance><h2>Relevance to Multimedia</h2>



Distributed multimedia apps rely on long-haul packet-switched networks, often 
for close-to-real-time data delivery (e.g. MBONE video).  We can't hope to 
design such services without a good understanding of the traffic patterns 
these apps will encounter over a WAN.



<hr><a name=rating><h2>Rating</h2>

5 out of 5: IMHO exposed many interesting dualities between network capacity 
vs. traffic and system performance vs. offered load.  The lessons to be drawn 
from each are similar and should guide us in network design.
