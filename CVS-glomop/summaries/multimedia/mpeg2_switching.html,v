<title>Summary: MPEG-2 Switching Facilities</title>

<h1>Switching Facilities in MPEG-2: Necessary But Not Sufficient</h1>

<hr><a name=content><h2>Content Summary</h2>

MPEG-2 provides hooks for "switching", i.e. realtime interpolation of different source content into a media stream, but the hooks provided are insufficient for the commercial requirements of cable and TV, especially compared to current analog systems. Problems include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Insufficiently tight bounds on stream parameters in MPEG-2 standard
<li>Effect of different transport stream data rates
<li>"Temporal lookahead" in heterogeneous encoded streams, resulting in unpredictable burstiness and buffering problems for statistical multiplexing
<li>Frequent need to do at least some amount of decoding and recoding in order to disassemble and splice streams in real time
</ul>

The author proposes standardized data and packet rates (integral multiples of things), standardized program element lengths (doesn¹t TV already have this?), standardized entry points for streams with guaranteed bounds on buffer conditions at those points, and building transitions into pre-encoded material (yeah, right).</p>

<hr><a name=relevance><h2>Relevance to Multimedia</h2>

MPEG-2 is the anointed HDTV format, and although it provides the mechanism for doing stream switching, it lacks sorely needed policy to make switching really feasible.

2 out of 5: A good point, but this paper should have been no more than 5 pages long.
