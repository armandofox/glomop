<hr><a name=content><h2>Content Summary</h2>

An overview of the state of the art in <i>perceptual image coding</i>
(compression based on elimination of redundant information as measured
by human perception metrics).  Introduces quantitative notion of
<i>perceptual entropy</i> as the lowest bit rate possible for achieving
perceived-lossless compression (just-noticeable distortion).  Proposes a
design space for perceptual coding algorithms whose axes are algorithm
complexity, communication latency, bit rate and quality.

<p>Discusses various "building blocks" of perceptual coding, including
DCT, quantization, subband coding, VQ, wavelets and table-based
compression, and shows how these interact in current compression schemes
(e.g. JPEG).  Video is still the area in which perceptual cues are least
understood.  Major research issues on the horizon are robustness,
scalability, portability, and a unified theory of noise masking.


<hr><a name=relevance><h2>Relevance to Multimedia</h2>

Good survey of how perceptual-coding schemes are put together and why
they are difficult to implement, and how perceptual metrics map to
quantitative parameters of algorithmic building blocks.

<hr><a name=rating><h2>Rating</h2>

3 out of 5: Valuable as a survey, but the "perceptual entropy" measure
was not developed very much once introduced.
