<title>Summary: NTSC</title>

<hr><h2>Content Summary</h2>

<p>NTSC maps RGB color space to YIQ: luminance (Y), which encodes
black-and-white (intensity) in a backwards-compatible way; orange/blue
(I); and purple/green (Q).  I and Q are then band-limited and
quadrature-encoded into a composite IQ signal C, which is shifted in
frequency space so its spectrum fits into the existing "gaps" in the
spectrum of Y.  Separation video transmits Y and C on separate wires;
composite video adds them together, using low-pass filters at the
decoder to separate them (with some loss of quality due to filtering
artifacts). </p>

<p>The RGB-to-YIQ mapping and band-limiting parameters are derived from
models of how the human eye responds to color and luminance changes from
a typical viewing distance.  Computer-generated hi-res RGB images that
exceed the band limits of NTSC result in nasty aliasing if not properly
band-limited before conversion, but NTSC can look quite good if the
hardware is adequate and the encoding done properly.</p>

<hr><h2>Relevance to Multimedia</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Demonstrates how elegant a hack is NTSC for representing color in a
       backwards-compatible way and within hardware cost and bandwidth
       constraints.
  <li>Demonstrates that NTSC has gotten a bad rap because it is often
       misused ("People who complain about not enough pixels are likely
       not using the ones they've got effectively").
</ul>

<hr><h2>Rating</h2>

4 out of 5: No new ideas, but an excellent exposition of the history,
technological and otherwise, behind NTSC's design tradeoffs.
