<h1>CCIR 601 Standard</h1>

<hr><a name=content><h2>Content Summary</h2>

Describes a digital component video standard that encompasses both 525
and 625 line analog systems by varying the number of bytes per line, to
fit either format into a uniform length stream, with a goal of worldwide
interoperability.</p>

The coding parameters are flexible enough to accommodate all the major
existing analog systems and several color sampling rates, and much of
the document reads like a "cookbook" for mapping the characteristics of
analog video (e.g. blanking interval) onto 601-style digital video
(e.g. inactive period in digital stream).  Also some discussion of
filtering characteristics for luminance and color-difference filters,
which I mostly skipped since I've forgotten 
how to interpret that stuff.</p>

<hr><a name=relevance><h2>Relevance to Multimedia</h2>

The One True Standard for digital video, that will subsume the differing
international analog standards: "SECAM is irrelevant. NTSC is
irrelevant.  You will be assimilated."

<hr><a name=rating><h2>Rating</h2>

3 out of 5: actually not that painful as standards documents go.
