<h1>The JPEG Still Picture Compression Standard</h1>
Gregory K. Wallace, CACM 34(4), April 1991

<hr><a name=content><h2>Content Summary</h2>

Description of the (then-immature) JPEG standard, which is actually a
"toolkit" of various compression techniques.  </p>
<p>JPEG goals:
<ul>
  <li>State of the art
  <li>General-purpose
  <li>computationally tractable
  <li>allow lossy (variable-quality), lossless, and hierarchical
       encoding
  <li>allow progressive encoding (based on image features rather than
       sequential scan)
</ul>

<p>Some components, such as the DCT implementation and the encoding of
image meta-information (aspect ratio, color space, etc.), are omitted
from the standard.  The standard allows for multiple images with
separate quantization tables and specifies an interchange format.  (How
is colormap information handled?  The article wasn't clear on this.)
</p>
<p>Predictive lossy or lossless coding provides the functionality for
hierarchical (multiresolution) coding: downsample, interpolate,
upsample, predict, difference.
</p>

<hr><a name=relevance><h2>Relevance to Multimedia</h2>

A general-purpose, portable set of standards for image coding, designed
explicitly to deal with photograph-quality (as opposed to halftone etc.)
images.  This emphasis is what differentiates JPEG from other graphic
compression standards and makes it particularly relevant to multimedia.

<hr><a name=rating><h2>Rating</h2>

4 out of 5: discrete cosine transfers are boring, but at least this is a
readable exposition and provides some history of how the JPEG committee
came to be and how the standard was arrived at.
