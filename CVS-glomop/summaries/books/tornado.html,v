<h1>Development of Hypergrowth Markets</h1>

<a name="chasm"><h3>Crossing the chasm, and beyond</h3></a>

<ul>
  <li>  Technology Adoption Life Cycle
       <ul>
         <li> Innovators (technology enthusiasts)
         <li> Early adopters (visionaries; risk takers; motivated by future
              opportunities; seek the possible)
         <li> Early majority (pragmatists; risk averse; motivated by present
              problems; pursue the probable; move as a herd)
         <li> Late majority (conservatives)
         <li> Laggards/skeptics (ignore them)
       </ul>
  <li> Market life cycle
       <ul>
         <li> Early market: visionaries/enthusiasts
         <li> Chasm: early market wanes, mainstream not yet ready
         <li> Bowling alley: niche-based, highly customer-centric adoption
         <li> Tornado: mass market adoption; "ignore" customer needs and
              ship mass volumes of standardized product
         <li> Main Street: aftermarket development; "whole product + 1"
              niche-specific plays, bundling, etc.
         <li> End of life
       </ul>
</ul>

<a name="ba"><h3>In the bowling alley</h3></a>
<ul>
  <li> "Bowling pin" model: establish one beachhead.  Then branch out to
       other beachheads, varying one aspect of your product (relative to
       previous beachhead) for each new one.  Resulting structure looks
       tree-like.
  <li> <b>Your markets are defined by your customers'
       applications, not by your products.</b>  Early customers need 100%
       solutions for a compelling reason-to-buy, or they're not
       interested.  Focus all your energy on doing this, and your competitors
       won't be able to match your <i>total value.</i>
  <li> Example: Sun started with CASE and CAD applications, and
       eventually defined a new category (technical workstation).
       <b>Lesson:</b> Although Apollo had been in the <i>product
       category</i> well before, when the <i>market category</i>
       appeared it was Sun that was in the lead and gained benefits of
       market leadership.  But when Sun went after "commodity"
       workstation market, it failed because the whole product was not
       there (lacked legacy compatibility and system integration).
  <li> <b>Market leadership is key.</b>  You must completely
       extinguish competitors in your market category, because when the
       pragmatists finally buy, they <i>want</i> to rally around a
       market leader.  They want an ordered market with well defined
       reference points.  Once you have this status, it's for life.
  <li> <b>Pick on someone your own size.</b>  It's better to have total
       dominance within one segment than partial dominance in many.
       Similarly, don't underestimate the effort required to tackle the
       next segment, because in so doing you will <i>create a market for
       your competitors</i> when you can't deliver.
  <li> <b>Sell economic benefit.</b>  If you try to market horizontally,
       you are playing on IT's turf, but IT is resistant to
       change at this stage.  So focus on the <i>economic buyer</i>:
       study their
       application deeply, become familiar with their business, and
       offer a solution that saves them
       money.    (Visionaries can't usually help here because by nature
       they can't focus on the mundane details of completely filling any
       single niche.)
  <li> When sales in your new category start to add up, the market
       shifts its organization to accommodate the new category.
       <b>Whoever is most visible when this happens is declared the
       market leader.</b>
  <li> <b>Reasons not to use</b> to the bowling alley strategy:
       <ul>
         <li> Most companies execute it half-assedly.  It's a
              territory-capture game, not a sales promotion tactic, and
              it will absorb all your energy.
         <li> Some companies stay in their niches for life.  This is OK,
              but if there's a tornado, the company will be caught
              unable to commoditize/standardize its product before a
              competitor does.  The "tornado killer app" will be <i>less
              than</i> the bowling pin solutions, and will involve more
              naive users.
         <li> Lure of recurrent service revenues prevents companies from
              designing pared-down commoditized product.
         <li> Sometimes the structure of the consumer market doesn't
              support bowling alley strategy.  Example: 3DO.
       </ul>
  <li> <b>Bowling alley benefits summary</b>
       <ul>
         <li> Simplification of the whole-product  challenge
         <li> Inherently profitable niches
         <li> Capturable territories for upcoming tornado
         <li> Leverage one segment for victory in others
       </ul>

</ul>

<a name="to"><h3>Inside the tornado</h3></a>

<ul>
  <li> <b>Tornado bootstrapping:</b> if IT moves too soon, risk is
       high.  If they move too late, they get trapped in obsolete
       technologies.  "We all move together, all pick the same vendor,
       and when the move starts, we want to get it over with fast."
  <li> <b>Just ship.</b>  No new features, no new marketing, just can
       the sardines.  You, not the customer, are the gating item now.
  <li> Once the "gorilla" has entered tornado, there will be more
       customers than it can handle. The leftovers are left for "chimps"
       (gorillas that didn't get picked) and "monkeys" (clones that
       enter late and fill a void, as AMD is to Intel).
  <li> <b>Lessons from Oracle, a tornado of the 80s.</b>
       <ul>
         <li> Attack competition ruthlessly.  Tornado market is
              zero-sum.  A customer I win is one you lose, for life.
              Genghis Khan: "It is not enough that we win -- all others
              must lose."  Each year, Oracle targeted a specific
              competitor to take out.
         <li> Expand distribution channels as fast as possible. Oracle
              grew its sales force 100% per year during its tornado.
         <li> Ignore the customer (your former economic buyers).  The
              penalty for poor customer 
              satisfaction is negligible compared to the rewards for
              getting the next customer, and the only way to serve the
              large customer base is "just ship".
       </ul>
  <li> <b>Lessons from HP in the printer business:</b>
       <ul>
         <li> Its corporate culture, based on consensus decision making
              and trust, enabled its divisions to operate scalably and
              "just ship".
         <li> Extend channels of distribution: leave no shelf unfilled,
              or your competitors will fill it.
         <li> Drive to the next lower price point, and you'll get first
              crack at a new customer base.
       </ul>
  <li> <b>Lessons from Intel/Microsoft strategy:</b>
       <ul>
         <li> Recruit partners to create a whole product.
         <li> Institutionalize the product as market leader.
         <li> Design your partners' features into your product, thus
              eliminating the partners.  Partners understand this
              strategy, but they play along because there's big money in
              it.  (J.L. Gassee: "Picking up dimes in front of steamrollers")
         <li> Examples: MS Office; Intel multimedia, DSP, and SMP features
              built into CPU's.
       </ul>
  <li> <b>Lessons of tornado markets:</b>  (note how Apple's decision
       not to license MacOS runs counter to these lessons)
       <ul>
         <li> Market <i>will</i> be served; it's just a matter of
              who will serve them.
         <li> Too much for any one company to control (or prevent), so
              don't try. 
         <li> Don't introduce discontinuity.
         <li> Design service out, not in.  It's unsustainable to be
              perceived as the "integrator" of things that are perceived
              as already integrated.
         <li> Do everything you can to sell to end users; ignore the
              economic/infrastructure buyers.
