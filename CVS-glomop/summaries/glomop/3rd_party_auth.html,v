3rd Party Authentication

<h1>
Third Party Authentication in the Institutional File System
</h1>
<strong>
Bill Doster and Jim Rees
</strong>

<p><b>One-line summary:</b>
Indirect authentication using Kerberos, but with the twist that the
client is used as a service by the &quot;proxy&quot; device.
</p>

<h2>Overview/Main Points</h2>

<ul>
     <LI> The paper is definitely related work.  It describes a proxy-like
	  mechanism for acquiring access to Kerberized services via a proxy
	  on behalf of a client, just like Charon.  Their approach is
	  almost the opposite of ours (which is good for us).

 <LI> In their system, the proxy (they call it a &quot;translator&quot;)
      acts as a principle, and the client as a service.  The proxy gets a
      ticket for the &quot;client service&quot; using the usual Kerberos
      mechanism. It also acquires the TGT for the client (but cannot
      decrypt it since it doesn't have the client's secret key).

 <LI> The proxy passes the &quot;client service&quot; ticket to the client,
      so now it and the client share a session key Kc,proxy.  The proxy
      then passes the client's TGT to the client, the client decrypts it,
      and sends back the decrypted TGT and the key Kc,tgt to the proxy
      using the session key Kc,proxy.  The proxy can now independently access
      services on the client's behalf, since it has the client's TGT and
      the client's TGS session key.  (!!)

 <LI> Strengths of their system:
      <UL>
	   <LI> clients' interaction with the system is minimal
	   <LI> services and Kerberos infrastructure remain unmodified
	   <LI> clients' secret keys are never revealed
      </UL>
</ul>

<h2>Relevance</h2>

Of high relevance as a comparison to
<a href="http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~fox/charon">Charon</a>.

<h2>Flaws</h2>

<ul>
 <LI> clients' require a large part of the full-blown kerberos
   implementation (decrypting tickets, extracting ticket
   components, verifying authenticators, ...)
 <LI> proxies, if subverted, can request further services on
   behalf of the clients' without the clients' permission,
   since clients' have no control over proxies once they
   reveal their TGT/TGS credentials.

</ul>
