<h1>
DATAMAN Project: Towards a Mosaic-Like Location-Dependant
       [sic] Information Service for Mobile Clients
</h1>
<strong>
Arup Acharya, Tomasz Imielinski, B.R. Badrinath, Rutgers WINLAB
</strong>

<p><b>One-line summary:</b>
Map-centric approach: a web page defines a service with specific
temporal and spatial scope, 
implemented as cgi-bin scripts that get the user's current location from
the URL.  
</p>

<h2>Overview/Main Points</h2>

<ul>
  <li> Temporal and spatial scope of page data is attached to page
  <li> Resource-adaptive links: page has associated set of rsrc
       requirements necessary for client to retrieve it.  This isn't
       really resource adaptivity, IMHO -- if client doesn't have the
       required resources, it loses.
  <li> Narrowcast: seems like broadcast to the client, but request is
       intelligently routed to the one appropriate server (based on
       location, time, etc. info).  Ncast is proposed as a network
       primitive.
  <li> Delta publication: send only the changes since last accessed.
</ul>

<h2>Relevance</h2>

Very similar to Schilit et al. <a
href="customizing_mobile_apps.html">Customizing Mobile Apps</a>, but
less general.  Narrowcast idea is interesting, but no mention of how to
implement it.  

<h2>Flaws</h2>

<ul>
  <li> Resource annotations are not adaptive, but limiting.
  <li> Is research general enough to support non-map-centric apps (eg
       time-based only)?
  <li> No description of how to actually do narrowcast, and only a weak
       argument that it is needed (as opposed to, say, replication or
       querying a nameserver instead of putting new stuff in the network
       layer).
</ul>
