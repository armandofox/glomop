<h1>
Experience with a Wireless World Wide Web Client
</h1>
<strong>
Joel F. Bartlett, DEC WRL
</strong>

<p><b>One-line summary:</b>
WWW browsing with wireless (cellular) modem on PDA-class device is
feasible; latencies are tolerable if proxy and caching are used, and
"most" pages are acceptable on 320x240 mono screen.
</p>

<h2>Overview/Main Points</h2>

To separate fact from fiction in PDA hype, a text-only WWW client was
developed for Newton with Motorola ARDIS.  (This is before Envoy.)
<ul>
  <li> A dedicated proxy constructs a screen description designed for easy
       parsing on the Newton.
  <li> A web page can span multiple screens; PDA prefetches subsequent
       screens of same page.
  <li> Caching is done at PDA (and at proxy? hard to tell).
  <li> No graphics.
  <li> Latency: ~1s to display cached page; 2-3s to get one from proxy.
  <li> Standard wish list: lower power, fewer pieces (ie
       integrated communication device), wider deployment of standard
       wireless infrastructure, faster CPU's.
</ul>
