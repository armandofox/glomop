<h1>
Mobile Wireless Computing: Challenges in Data Management
</h1>
<strong>
Tomasz Imielisnky, B.R. Badrinath, Rutgers U.
</strong>

<p><b>One-line summary:</b>

</p>

<h2>Overview/Main Points</h2>
<ul>
<li>Challenges: mobility/scalability, poor NW¹s, power mgmt...the usual
<li>Mail enabled apps will constitute "core" of MC (!)
<li> Discussion of various wireless media, their flaws, etc; proxied computing for power mgmt
<li> Push of info from mobile to server: location-dependent, but seen as a network-layer (routing) problem.  Claim: Mobility doesn¹t affect application layer much.
<li> Challenge: how to locate user (location mgmt)
<li> Data broadcasting vs. interactive/on-demand approaches to BW mgmt (e.g. frequently rebroadcast frequently-used data items, treats air as a storage medium!)
</ul>
<h2>Relevance</h2>
The idea of treating air as storage medium (broadcast of frequently used items) is interesting.  Otherwise a discussion of the Rutgers mobile-IP and friends architecture.

<h2>Flaws</h2>
