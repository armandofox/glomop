<BODY>
<H1>A Proxy-Based Filtering Mechanism for the Mobile Environment</H1>
<H3>Bruce Zenel, Columbia CS</H3>
<B>One-line abstract: </B>App-level and socket-level distinct proxies running
on a server that does much muckage with IP bindings to provide backward
compat and/or impersonate the client. App-level filters (&quot;applets&quot;)
are sent from MH to proxy and executed there. 
<H2>Main points:</H2>
<UL>
<LI>Two simultaneous proxies: low-level for doing network protocol level
optimizations (ICMP echo, etc); high-level for app-specific filtering. 
<LI>High-level proxy runs <I>filters </I>that are downloaded from the MH.
<LI>Filters at proxy server <I>become</I> the client by mucking with IP
bindings! (client starts out e2e at MH) HLPS API's in C, at socket level;
for filters written in C, Java,... Applet fork and attach done w/Mach primitives.
<LI>Network-level filter agent sets up reusable paths from MH to proxy,
by mucking with network-level stuff. 
</UL>
<H2>Flaws/comments:</H2>
<UL>
<LI>Bending over backwards to preserve compatibility w/existing apps and
high-level protocols (eg &quot;proxied SMTP&quot;), even while doing some
hacks that effectively establish session state. Maybe better to define a
session layer and be done with it? 
<LI>No adaptation; no general architecture for app level framing of data
in the HLPS. 
<LI>Philosophical difference: we provide app compatibility by proxying the
server-side connection. His requires apps to be relinked with sock lib (or
runtime linking); we can support off-the-shelf Netscape &amp; Eudora. 
<LI>In general, these API's are at a much lower level than ours.
