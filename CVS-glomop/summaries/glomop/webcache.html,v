<h1>
A Caching Relay for the WWW
</h1>
<strong>
Steve Glassman, DEC SRC
</strong>

<p><b>One-line summary:</b>
A caching proxy with a 30-50% hit rate; size-limited cache, with aging
heuristic used to evict documents.  Users don't notice when it's turned
off. 
</p>

<h2>Overview/Main Points</h2>

<ul>
  <li> Zipf distribution used to model access pattern: n'th element
       accessed with probability 1/n
  <li> 30-50% hit rate for 80MB cache
  <li>  Users don't notice when it's turned off: they're used to wide
       variance in WWW latencies (latency to go outside SRC firewall is
       6-9 sec without cache)
  <li> Heuristic: check last mod time of a page, and assume it won't
       change for at least that long.  
</ul>

<h2>Relevance</h2>

Caching is needed on the Web.  This study suggests a single cache is not
very useful compared to cooperative caching, which isn't addressed.

<h2>Flaws</h2>
<ul>
  <li> Histogram of workload (distrib. of sizes of cached objects) would
       be nice.
  <li> No indication of how effective is the aging heuristic--but it
       does highlight the fact that some such mechanism is needed--even
       worse if we try to do semi-coherent cooperative caching.
  <li> Is Zipf distribution really a good model for accessed elements?
       Need a "Web survey" of some kind to back this up.
</ul>
