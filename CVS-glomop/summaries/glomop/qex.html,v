<h1>
Supporting Adaptive Services in a Heterogeneous Mobile Environment
</h1>
<strong>
 Nigel Davies, Gordon S. Blair, Keith Cheverst and Adrian
Friday. 
</strong>

<p><b>One-line summary:</b>
A worthless paper describing a "prototype" network-adaptive wireless
application based on network-quality-aware RPC, except that the
application is <i>not</i> network adaptive, it is <i>not</i> wireless,
and the RPC is <i>not</i> network aware and is buggy besides.
</p>

<h2>Overview/Main Points</h2>

<ul>
  <li> Heavyweight RDO system (similar to <a
       href=rover.html>Rover's</a>) encapsulates mobile objects
  <li> Invocations on objects are done by RPC ("ANSAware"), which is
       supposed to be network-aware, but is not, so it has
       TCP-over-wireless problems (premature timeouts, mistaking losses for
       congestion, etc.)
  <li> To fix this, network-aware RPC called QEX
       ("quality-of-service-driven
       execution") is "under development".  Many blue-sky statements
       about it but no concrete research direction stated.
  <li> Prototype app is audioconferencing+WB.  Current implementation
       runs on PC's with Ethernet -- what a breakthrough.  It will be
       "ported" to QEX in the future.
</ul>

<h2>Relevance</h2>

None; basically they have used RDO's to write an application and stated
that in the future, they will develop a QOS-driven RPC and port the
application to use it instead of the buggy RPC they now have.

<h2>Flaws</h2>

Too numerous to mention.
