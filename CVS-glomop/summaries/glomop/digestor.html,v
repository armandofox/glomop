<H1>Digestor: Device-Independent Access to the World-Wide Web</H1>

<B>One-line abstract: </B>
This paper is all about automatic reauthoring of pages for small devices; 
their focus is on aesthetics and optimal layout, not minimizing download time.

<H2>Main points:</H2>
<UL>
  <LI> depricates Unwired Planet manual reauthoring, multiple-device
    authoring (such as style sheets), client-side navigation (i.e.  select
    portion of larger page to view at any given time, like our
    segmentation, or magic lenses).
  <LI> operate on syntatic vs. semantic (structure vs. content) document,
    use elision vs. transformation (summarization vs. decimation)
  <LI> they manually reauthored some pages to get a feel for what's important
  <UL><LI> need to keep some images
      <LI> headers (H1-H6) often used incorrectly, used for style not structure
      <LI> &quot;semantic elision&quot; by removing frame sidebars works well
      <LI> pages can be heuristically categorized, category dictates strategy
      <LI> whitespace reduction works really well
  </UL>
  <LI> Digestor: bag of tricks plus categorization to pick appropriate trick
    based on particular page and also the target device
  <LI> tricks:
    <UL>
      <LI> outlining, first sentence extraction, image reduction by 
        const. factor, font size change
      <LI> &quot;heuristic planner&quot; to search possible transformation
        space, screen area as measure of merit of a heurisitic (!!!)
      <LI> sensible [pre|post|]conditions on heuristics for aesthetics
    </UL>
  <LI> implementation
      <UL>
        <LI> uses proxy, builts syntax tree from HTML, retrieves inlines,
        then launches heuristic planner to iteratively search transf.  space
        <LI> implemented in Java
      </UL>
</UL>
