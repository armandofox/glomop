<h1>
Explaining World Wide Web Traffic Self-Similarity
</h1>
<strong>
Mark E. Crovella and Azer Bestavros
</strong>

<p><b>One-line summary:</b>
WWW traffic is self-similar, and user's usage patterns exhibits ON/OFF
behaviour with heavy-tailed distributions of ON and OFF periods;  these
characteristics can be demonstrated to stem from people's access patterns
and the underlying distribution of file sizes on the web.
</p>

<h2>Overview/Main Points</h2>

<ul>
     <LI> WWW traffic is self-similar, although more so during busy
	  periods than non-busy periods.  <i>(This statement is intrinsically
	  flawed, since self-similarity must apply across all time periods
	  or it doesn't apply at all.)</i>  This self-similarity was
	  verified by a number of well-known statistical methods.
	  
     <LI> Data on user-access patterns was gathered by instrumenting the
	  Mosaic browser of Boston University CS department users - Mosaic
	  was still popular when the study was done.  Note that traffic
	  from a set of users to the rest of the web was measured, not
	  traffic from all users on the web to a single web site.

     <LI> User traffic was shown to exhibit ON/OFF behaviour.  In other
	  words, there were periods of high activity followed by periods of
	  no activity.  Both the ON and OFF period lengths were
	  heavy-tailed (ie. there is a non-trivial probability of a very
	  large period length).

     <LI> The heavy-tails of ON periods were shown to be related to the
	  heavy-tailed distribution of file sizes on the web.  All types of
	  files were seen to be heavy tailed, although multimedia files
	  (video/audio) were slightly more so.  The results were verified
	  by consulting the logs of 32 web servers around North America;
	  the file size distribution observed in their client browser
	  traces matched those in the web server logs quite well.  This
	  further suggests that sampling web traffic via client browser
	  traces provides a representative view of web traffic in general.

     <LI> There was a strong inverse relationship between file size and the
	  frequency that the file was requested - the files that were most
	  frequently requested were small files (<i>256 - 512 bytes - this
	  must be .html files</i>).  This implies that client
	  browser caches tend to satisfy many small file requests,
	  increasing the weight of the tail of observed file requests over
	  the network.  (It was stated that client browser caches satisfied
	  77% of web requests.)

     <LI> There was a knee in the curve for OFF period length
	  distributions.  The two components observed (period lengths
	  between 1ms and 1 sec, and period lengths above 30 secs,
	  therefore with the knee between 1 sec and 3 secs) were attributed
	  to two scenarios in which OFF periods could be observed.  The
	  first is due to the workstation rendering
	  previously retrieved data before requesting more - this is
	  called &quotActive OFF&quot.  The second is due to the user
	  inspecting data and not using the web at all - this is called
	  &quotInactive OFF&quot.
</ul>

<h2>Relevance</h2>

<ul>
     <LI> Client traces are publically available.  We should use them
	  in our scalability study.
     <LI> Results suggest web traffic patterns are related to human's usage
	  patterns and file sizes on the web, rather than artifacts of
	  web protocol and document processing by machines, and therefore
	  these patterns are likely to remain.
     <LI> We must come to grips with these patterns when designing our
	  proxy.  Fundamentally the news is good - we can expect bursty
	  accesses, and small documents to be access more frequently than
	  large documents.  The bad news is that peak traffic is going to
	  be very very large.
</ul>

<h2>Flaws</h2>

<ul>
     <LI> Analysis of user traffic was done by instrumenting web browsers at
	  their university.  If people were aware of the instrumentation,
	  it may affect their usage patterns.  Furthermore, the populace of
	  a university is not a typical cross-section of world-wide web
	  users.
     <LI> Self-similarity analysis done for the busiest hours measured.
	  By definition, this is atypical traffic.
     <LI> Not nearly enough data was analyzed for the strength of the
	  conclusions they presented, IMHO.
</ul>
