<h1>
TCP Extensions for Space Communication (aka SCPS-TP)
</h1>
<strong>
R.C. Durst and G.J. Miller (MITRE) and E.J. Travis (Gemini Industries)
</strong>

<p><b>One-line summary:</b>
Roll together many TCP-for-wireless optimizations, but change them
slightly, in order to adapt TCP for communication with satellites, the
space shuttle, etc.
</p>

<h2>Overview/Main Points</h2>

<ul>
  <li> Standard problems: long fat pipe; errors from radiation, etc. may
       be bursty or periodic (orbit); asymmetric (typ. 1000:1); TCP
       aborts after n retransmissions
  <li> Use TCP Vegas (RTT, not loss, indicates congestion).  Since
       doesn't use receive window size as upper bound on pipe filling,
       enables large windows for long fat network.
  <li> Use open loop rate control rather than ACKs to clock out data.
  <li> Explicit notification via ICMP of corruption or outage from
       downstream routers: sources enter persistent mode, probing until
       outage goes away.  When no explicit notification, assume a
       default cause of loss (configurable).
  <li> Use "stateless" TCP header compression (similar to RFC ??? but
       nonconformant) to avoid "cascading loss" problem.
  <li> Use selective NAK rather than go-back-N (similar to RFC 2018, but
       nonconformant)
</ul>

<h2>Relevance</h2>

TCP In Space!  About time we started adapting proven protocols rather
than rewriting from scratch for each mission (this is what NASA has done
to date).  

<h2>Flaws</h2>
<ul>
  <li> Too bad it's non-interoperable, but the changes seem
innocuous and could be handled in gateway routers.
  <li> Except for the
       explicit notification of reason for lossage, this is just all of
       the wireless TCP improvements rolled into one.
</ul>
