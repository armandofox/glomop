<H1>Connecting Mobile Workstations to the Internet Over a Digital Cellular
Telephone Network</H1>

<B>One-line abstract: </B>Indirect TCP type approach in which MH apps can
use either traditional TCP or Mowgli sockets (socket/transport/dgram/network
layer that replaces TCP/IP but provides similar API).  Both connection types
go through a wired proxy.  Disconnection handled in transport layer.
<H2>Main points:</H2>
<UL>
<LI>TCP/M-IP compatible indirect-TCP implementation using &quot;Mowgli sockets&quot;
API. Mowgli Socket Interface Protocol is like ICMP for wireless link; Mowgli
Wireless Link Proto does stuff like header compression, etc. 
<LI>Mowgli Virtual Socket Layer demuxes stuff to either Berkeley sockets
or Mowgli Wireless Msg Protocol/Mowgli Socket/MWLP stack.  (See fig. 5 in
paper.
<LI>&quot;Mobile-aware&quot; apps can use additional mobility support in
M-sockets, e.g. &quot;QoS interface&quot; (proposed but not defined). 
<LI>Claim: proxy is not a bottleneck; slow wireless link is (by defn). 
<LI>Future work: distinguishing different qualitative types of communication
service needed by apps, and develping QoS models; specification of services
needed for mobility awareness; security (no elaboration given).
<LI>Great architecture for dealing w/disconnection, if you're willing to
do that at the transport layer - an open argument.
<LI>The Mowgli Socket Protocol they talk about seems to have evolved into
the MWLP/MDCP described in the <A HREF="mowgli_www.html">Mowgli-WWW paper
summary.</A>
</UL>
<H2>Flaws/comments:</H2>
<UL>
<LI>QoS discussion lacking - no direct specification of the QoS params (but
then, neither do we...)
<LI>Indirect TCP was done before and has been shown to not necessarily be
a good thing; main point here seems to be to provide Mowgli sockets as the
&quot;preferred&quot; MH interface, but to allow for a compatible interface
as well.
<LI>Not clear if the transport layer is the place to deal w/disconnection;
isn't that more an end-to-end problem that applications should solve?  (Though
GloMop deals with part of it in session layer, it notifies apps of disconnection,
and can serve a disconnection request from an app.)
