<h1>Bob Machlin, VP Tech Mkt, Ascend (9/7)</h1>
<font SIZE="2">

<p></font>I identified 4 &quot;lessons for the future&quot; from Bob Machlin's talk. The
first revolved around the tension between vision and markets. This tension is particularly
noticeable in companies in Ascend's situation, which were not only trying to create a new
market and product category, but doing it against the established wisdom. Mr. Machlin
explained how Cascade faced an uphill battle and was turned down by many venture
capitalists, though it ultimately succeeded in its technical program and now has about 70%
market share in raw public data traffic. He also mentioned that &quot;the world is
different today&quot;. Curiously, I think we now have the opposite problem: hype is louder
than ever, it is frequently not backed up by any fundamentally revolutionary technology or
value proposition, yet a lot of money is being spent by private and institutional
investors who want to avoid losing out on a great proposition. For CEO's and CTO's of
today's startups, particularly those that are in fact trying to define their own category,
there is the risk that hype might result in unrealistic customer expectations, which would
in turn result in the company setting itself up for failure in the market it is trying to
create/define.</p>

<p>Mr. Machlin spent some time talking about segment marketing and the importance of
clearly articulating the value proposition to each segment and understanding each
segment's buying patterns. Although this might seem obvious, many high tech startups
(especially those that started as research spin-offs or were otherwise technology-driven)
are at a loss to concretely define their own value proposition. There is increasingly a
general feeling in such early stage companies that &quot;if we build it, they will
come&quot;. My own experience has included at least one case where the effect of the
symptom was particularly acute: a main target market for one of the products was
small-to-medium ISP's, who are typically already competing on razor-thin margins, have
very little capital to spend, and tend to frame value propositions in terms of the amount
of money they can save per subscriber per month. Mr. Machlin also mentioned the increasing
importance of &quot;awareness&quot; marketing (as in Intel Inside (tm) and the recent
Cisco campaign), as a way to identify oneself to the consumer segment and possibly
stimulate second-order demand there (&quot;I want a PC with an Intel processor&quot;) even
when the product is not sold directly to consumers.</p>

<p>An interesting point Mr. Machlin made concerned the cost/benefit tradeoff of building a
particular product -- or perhaps the lack of such a tradeoff. To paraphrase him, unless a
project violates the laws of physics, if someone with enough money can be convinced to
build it then it will be built. Today there are various Internet services that have
reached a staggering scale just this way, even though technically they rarely represent
the most elegant or appropriate large-scale solution to the problem. For example, UUnet
has a frighteningly complex layer of routing and optimization far below IP, because the
demand for capacity build-out far exceeded the possibility that IP-level routing could be
correctly re-engineered (and the appropriate new IP routing equipment redeployed) at a
pace that could keep up with the demand.</p>

<p>Finally, another lesson that appears to be too often lost on new high tech startups:
sales and marketing are where it's at, and to the extent the CEO has direct visibility, he
should be going out to large accounts (especially getting reference accounts) and doing
&quot;full contact&quot; sales and marketing with important large customers. Surprisingly,
many high tech startups seem to have engineering resources that far outweigh sales and
marketing, and perhaps unsurprisingly, the initial products seem to lack direction and the
company as a whole to lack a mission. Mr. Machlin's stories from the front lines suggest
that the survival of a young company in a hostile market may depend completely on the
performance of the first few large reference accounts; if so we can expect the engineering
demands engendered by catering to those accounts to shape the company's technical mission
(and perhaps even its longer term marketing vision), so it shouldn't be surprising that
the lack of a strong (and technically knowledgeable) sales and marketing organization may
lead to early defocus.</p>

<p>A personal observation: despite some student complaints to the contrary, I found Mr.
Machlin's technological side excursions more than reasonable -- if for no other reason
than it gave him additional credibility with the non-marketing contingent in the class,
itself an important property when you're out selling the dream and have to address
technical personnel at the customer's organization. (And as Mr. Machlin said, large
customers won't buy stuff over the Internet -- they will expect a hands on real-life demo
and will do their own technical evaluation.)</p>

<h1>Curt Schacker, VP Tech Mkt ??, Wind River Systems</h1>

<p>Much of Mr. Schacker's talk focused on how a company responds to the changing shape of
its industry. WRS finds itself in an embedded market that for the first time is becoming
horizontal and customizable, based on open standards and published API's.&nbsp; Until
recently, embedded systems had been completely vertical/dedicated, which is painful for EC
buyers but great for suppliers who can essentially charge for a whole new embedded system
for each new vendor product.&nbsp; The horizontalization of the EC industry is comparable
to the horizontalization of the PC (and now, the palm-sized PC) by Microsoft and Intel: a
reasonable niche-market has developed for selling silicon and EC's into specialized
embedded applications.</p>

<p>This kind of development brings other challenges as well.&nbsp; There are new technical
challenges as the User Interface and wide-area networking capabilities become expectations
of the embedded OS; these are driven by the mass adoption of wide-area open protocols (eg
TCP/IP and the Web protocols) and a &quot;universal user interface&quot; as defined
roughly by HTML forms.&nbsp; Mr. Schacker described this as &quot;everything's connected,
everything's interactive&quot;, which changes the competitive landscape for a company like
WRS.&nbsp; Previously they considered their main competition to be other integrators or
vendors of embedded components or systems (Mr. Schacker mentioned ISI); with the shift to
the new horizontalized playing field (no pun intended), the competition are now Microsoft
and Sun.&nbsp; With Windows CE and its palm-sized device technology, Microsoft is suddenly
a threat to WRS: although the industry consensus is that CE has a long way to go in order
to compet technically with Wind RIver and others, Microsoft will eventually get it right,
and in the meantime they have a lot of marketing muscle and extensive experience in
playing in the horizontalized market.&nbsp; Sun is trying a similar strategy with Java,
but their lack of seasoning in the horizontal market shows--Java seems to be rapidly
losing ground to technologically inferior alternatives such as proprietary Windows-based
languages and protocols, and is finding a home mostly in earlier adopters or
nontraditional players who are not accustomed to the PC arena (obscure device vendors, for
example).</p>

<p>Also because of horizontalization, the buy vs. build analysis for potential customers
is rapidly changing; it rarely makes economic sense for a vendor to build its own embedded
OS anymore, especially considering time-to-market.&nbsp; Thus there is a measurable
benefit to being able to offer a nimble, component-based, &quot;customize as you go&quot;
embedded solution.&nbsp; Interestingly, Wind River chose not to pursue its own branding
for such offerings because even though such a strategy has been successfully executed by
suppliers in the PC market (&quot;Intel inside&quot;), WRS believed that their customers
would not be comfortable giving end users the &quot;WindRiver user experience&quot; as
opposed to (say) the &quot;Sony user experience&quot;.&nbsp; In other words, they
recognize the role of differentiation for their end users now that the core EC technology
is becoming commoditized.&nbsp; In response to this, they have identified the technology
role where they would like to be the &quot;choke point&quot; (just as Win32 is the
&quot;choke point&quot; for desktop and now small-enterprise software API's); Mr. Schacker
cited a specific example in which WRS bought a GUI company, then publicized its API
(including to their own competitors!) to make the whole pie bigger while effectively
retaining control of an important emerging piece of it.&nbsp; (The Apple vs. Microsoft OS
licensing approach sounds similar: Microsoft opened up every possible API and relied on
installed base, early adopters, and control of the API's, whereas Apple did the opposite
and basically drove themselves into the ground.)&nbsp; This example was consistent with
Mr. Schacker's position (which he claimed was WRS's position) that it is &quot;incumbent
on mkt leader to move the market forward and create new opportunities&quot;, i.e. enlarge
the pie, even at expense of current design wins (which the company did suffer short-term
as a result of their strategy).&nbsp; I suspect that many start-ups, jealously guarding
their technology from competitors, have not successfully learned this useful lesson which
applies almost uniquely to heavily horizontal playing fields.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Biotech barrier is roughly $300M up to $1B; but profit correspondingly high due to
    patents (or sometimes trade secrets; e.g. Premarin has been off patent for years, yet
    still high profit)</li>
  <li>Biotech Bay - the bay area is largest concentration of biotech in the world now</li>
  <li>product selection crucial (drop bad projects early &amp; get world class tech advice);
    need $$$; good scientifically-competent mgmt scarce; competition for talent intense;
    &quot;big pharma&quot; collabs needed since everyone else does it; IP is valuable; FDA
    approval unpredictable (compare to hi tech startup lessons)</li>

<ul>
  <li>Embedded systems becoming horizontal/customizable/open (as opposed to hardwired at mfg
    time)</li>
  <li>Decent mkt for selling silicon &amp; embedded OS's into specialized embedded apps
    (compare WIndoze)</li>
  <li>Trends: everything's connected, everything's interactive (embedded UI and wide-area
    networking).</font><font SIZE="2"></li>
  <li>Strategic inflection: used to consider the competition other embedded/integration co's
    (like ISI).&nbsp; Now it's Microsoft (WinCE) and to a lesser extent Sun (Java, JavaRings,
    etc.)</font><font SIZE="2"></li>
  <li>My question: is WinCE really a competitor given that they're targeting consumer stuff?
    A: they have a big tech challenge to migrate from consumer stuff to &quot;real&quot;
    industrial embedded systems, but they want to do it.</font><font SIZE="2"></li>
  <li>WRS chose <em>not</em> to do branding (&quot;powered by&quot;) because of the immense
    expense and logistical challenge.&nbsp; Assume that TV makers, etc will be nervous to
    allow consumers to have the &quot;MS experience&quot; (not the &quot;Sony
    experience&quot;) when the TV is turned on.</font><font SIZE="2"></li>
  <li>Prod strategy: TTM, reliability, differentiation; product vs solution (who is the
    integrator?); core and enabling technologies are the value add</font><font SIZE="2"></li>
  <li>Pricing strategy: buy vs build analysis (includes TTM and TT$ for customer, and
    reusability); a new market (becoming less economically viable for companies to write their
    own OS's)</font><font SIZE="2"></li>
  <li>Philosophy: &quot;it's incumbent on mkt leader to move mkt forward and create new
    opportunities&quot; (even at expense of current design wins!)</font><font SIZE="2"></li>
  <li>Vertical vs. horizontal marketing strategies; WRS buys into vision that the embedded
    world is horizontalizing, so identify where they want to be the choke point (like Win32).
    &nbsp; Example: bought a GUI company, then publicized API (including to competitors) to
    make the whole pie bigger.&nbsp; Compare Apple vs Microsoft.</font><font SIZE="2"></li>
