<title>Market Segmentation &amp; Research</title>

<h1>9/14: Tech Adoption Lifecycle</h1>

<ul>
  <li>Tech startup: typ focus is tech value to customer (contrast consumer products)</li>
  <li>Customer FUD, no track record, company financially uncertain, support after sales?</li>
  <li>Is management team there?&nbsp; Capable of executing? Will product function technically?</li>
  <li>Customer ideas: sell your software--&gt;sell your IDE</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Pitfalls</strong> 

<ul>
  <li>product ahead of its time or no market (or too small)</li>
  <li>poor cash planning &amp; management resulting in too many alliances (de-focusing) or
    &quot;desperate&quot; ones (need cash); pitfall is getting caught up in enthusiasm for
    opportunity</li>
  <li>sale of technology licenses (the goose) instead of products (golden eggs)</li>
  <li>dependent on other technologies for its success</li>
</ul>

<h1>9/28: Market segmentation &amp; research</h1>

<h3>How to win your segment</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Objective: identify segment, size, projected size in future/growth, </li>
  <li>Distinguish products that require changes in customer behavior from those that don't
    (displacing a competitor's &quot;similar&quot; product)</li>
  <li>&quot;Must have&quot; product might be because it's the only way for customer to stay
    competitive or staunch market share loss.&nbsp; How is their success measured? &nbsp;
    Target that.&nbsp; Different for different segments, even for same product.</li>
  <li>Define product according to what the customer's business is--not yours (does Revlon make
    cosmetics or sell hope?)&nbsp; You become an extension of their business.</li>
</ul>

<h1>10/12: Product definition</h1>

<ul>
  <li>Whole product concept: don't forget <em>future potential</em> as a component. &nbsp;
    Argue that customer will be able to compete better in the future.&nbsp; In hi-tech,
    concern is that <em>platform/basic technology will be extensible.</em></li>
  <li>Recent criticism of Ascend: they have best products, but they're selling <em>boxes</em>
    (whereas competitors are selling &quot;voice communication over IP strategy&quot;) -
    customers don't understand significance of newly launched product without having a clear
    solution strategy</li>
  <li>Whole product also includes installation, post-sale support, customer confidence in
    supplier, service...</li>
  <li>The artifact just lets you into the game, but it's not the product!&nbsp; (Also need to
    define that artifact, but do so in the context of Whole Product.)</li>
  <li><em>Augmentations </em>(eg Office97 which cusomter may not need) can be a
    differentiator/addictor.&nbsp; <strong>Caveat</strong>: augmentation may become
    expectation. <strong>Caveat</strong>: some may simply prefer lower prices to more
    features.</li>
  <li>Cost of complete product may be many times the cost of the artifact.&nbsp; In a new
    field, no past trend data to help you here.</li>
  <li>If customer can't use it effectively, product is useless.&nbsp; (Is it broken? Does user
    understand how to use?&nbsp; Is customer's problem the same as it was when product was
    bought?&nbsp; Is there a lack of service/support?)</li>
  <li>Axes for measuring whole product: functional; manufacturable; serviced &amp; supported;
    saleable;distributable; applicable to customer problem.&nbsp; Product must be defined
    differently during different phases of Tech Adopt Life Cycle.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Midterm topics:</strong> market research, segmentation, segment of focus,
growth, product definition.</p>

<h1>10/26: Product positioning &amp; differentiation</h1>

<ul>
  <li><em>Customers and market</em> (and media?) position you according to tech
    differentiation, leadership, financial stability, all sorts of other intangibles.
    &nbsp; You can at best influence them.&nbsp; Know what you'd like your position to be and
    make sure it's feasible. (E.g. most startups can't be seen as high volume suppliers.)</li>
  <li>Once positioned, it's difficult to challenge/change.</li>
  <li>Positioning strategy begets marketing strategy.&nbsp; To develop a positioning strategy,
    consider company resources, product timing, product differentiation (more on this later),
    market forces (infrastructure, distributors, analysts, FUD, trends, competitors)</li>
  <li>Target a niche where there's weak competition.&nbsp; Could be technological,
    geographical, service...</li>
  <li>How to gain credibility: inference/association with successful company (for startups);
    reference accounts and repeat orders; evidence (financial/performance data)</li>
  <li>Other factors: financial success; management/investors/exec team reputation (e.g. Steve
    Jobs returning to Apple); corporate history/location/culture</li>
  <li> Positioning hints, from Moore: "For (customer) who needs (customer
       problem), the (product name) is a (product category) that
       provides (key benefit/compelling reason to buy).  Unlike (competitor),
       our product (key differentiators)."</li>
  <li> Differentiation: something beyond the generic product.</li>
  <li> Distribution can be differentiator (customers frequently more
       tied to their distributor than to their suppliers; compare in PC
       market)</li>
  <li> Intangibles due to shifting markets and customer needs; can you
       use this to advantage in differentiating yourself?  Can you
       design these into the product?</li>
  <li> Support and service can be major differentiators--often more
       than the product.</li>
  <li> Image and culture.  HP's "quality" image allows it to sell its
       stuff for twice as much as competitors', even if competitors have
       comparable quality in practice.</li>
</ul>

<h1>10/26-11/2 Product Planning</h1>

<ul>
  <li> Most serious mistakes: wrong product, wrong timing, wrong market</li>
  <li> Execution errors can usually be fixed; planning problems often
       can't</li>
  <li> Esp. in high tech, and esp. for new product or new/uncertain markets,
       details beyond general direction have to be
       identified during implementation.</li>
  <li> Plan must be updated continuously.  Don't trust it completely.
       (This is different from not looking at it after it's done!)
</ul>
