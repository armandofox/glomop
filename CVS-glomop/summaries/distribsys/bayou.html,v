<p><b>One-line summary:</b>
From-the-ground-up design of a weakly consistent, highly available,
replicated shared database using peer-to-peer anti-entropy, per-write
merge and update functions, and selectable consistency/availability
tradeoff at the clients.
</p>

<h2>Overview/Main Points</h2>

<ul>
  <li> High availability for reads and writes: use read-any/write-any
       weakly consistent replication.
  <li> Eventual consistency with minimal assumptions about communication
       characteristics: Peer-peer anti-entropy to propagate updates.
  <li> Detect and resolve update conflicts: dependency checks on each
       write, application-specific merge proc passed w/each write.
  <li> Commit to stable value ASAP: primary server sets commit ordering.
  <li> Disconnected operation while allowing groups to see their own
       updates: allow client to read "tentative" data with expectation
       that it will be committed with the same effect if possible.
  <li> Client's view should be consistent with its own updates: range of
       selectable session guarantees:
       <ul>
         <li> Read your own writes
         <li> Monotic reads (successive reads reflect non-decreasing set
              of writes)
         <li> Writes follow reads: writes propagated after the reads on
              which they depend
         <li> Monotonic writes: writes propagated after writes that
              logically precede them
         <li> Age parameter allowed on reads
         <li> Choice of tentative or committed on reads
       </ul>
  <li> Flexible control over placement and use of DB's: number and
       locations of DB's can vary over time, as can its primary server.
       Scales OK since anti-entropy is peer-to-peer.
</ul>
