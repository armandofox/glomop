<h1>
Techniques for Privacy and Authentication in Personal
Communication Systems
</h1>
<strong>

<p><b>One-line summary:</b>
Authentication and privacy techniques used in GSM and IS-95 are
presented, and the generic public/private key technique used as a
basis for comparison.
</p>

<h2>Overview/Main Points</h2>

<UL>

<LI><B>General model:</B> Authentication and key agreement (AKA) proceeds
in three phases.  <i>Provisioning</i> is the initial dispersement of
secrets to the handset and network, and occurs when the user buys the
handset.  <i>Visitor setup</i> occurs when a handset establishes
credibility in a foreign network with a VLR (visited location register).
<i>Call setup</i> occurs when a user makes a call either in a home or
a visited location.

<LI><B>GSM Method:</B> In the GSM world, a shared secret 128 bit key
<i>Ki</i> is given to a user in a smart card, and recorded in the home
network when the user buys the handset.  When a user roams to a
VLR, the HLR sends a list of (RAND, SRES, Kc) challenge, expected
response, conventional session key triplets to the VLR.  These triplets
are used by the VLR on a one-time basis to validate a roaming cellphone
on call setup.  Note that the HLR never reveals <i>Ki</I> to the VLR,
or anyone else for that matter, and neither does the cellphone.  Users
are assigned temporary mobile station identities (tmsi) when they first
register with a network that prevents them from having to use their
true identities in subsequent registration, enabling anonymity.

<LI><B>IS41/IS-54/IS-95 Method:</B> When a user buys a cellphone, the
HLR snail-mails the user a 64-bit secret A-Key that the user types
into the phone.  When a user visits a VLR, a shared secret data key
SSD is derived from the A-Key and sent to the VLR by the HLR; this SSD
can also be derived by the cell-phone, and is used to validate the
cellphone to the VLR on call setup.  Replay attacks are avoided using
a &quotcall count&quot monotonically increasing register.  A single
challenge is broadcast to all cellphones by the VLR;  each cell-phone
wanting access uses its SSD to compute a response containing its ID
and call count.

<LI><B>Public/Secret Key method:</B> Users chose public/private key
pairs (I suppose an algo does it for them), and get their public key
and identity certified by a certification authority (CA).  Similarly,
networks have their public keys certified.  The certificate is encoded
using the CA's secret key.  Handsets obtain a serving network's certificate
and then uses the network's public key to send encrypted authorization
information.

</UL>

<h2>Relevance</h2>

PCS privacy and authentication is a serious issue that has not
historically been satisfactorily addressed by vendors.  GSM
and IS-95 have barely acceptable strategies;  the public/secret
key method described is well known to be stronger.

<h2>Flaws</h2>

<UL>

<LI> There are weaknesses in public/private key strategies that
this paper doesn't mention, like replay attacks for false
authentication (solved with nonces), private-key discovery by
an evil hacker with physical access, etc.  Such weaknesses
should be presented.
