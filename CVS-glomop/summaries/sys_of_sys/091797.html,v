<h1>Virtualizing the Network Interface</h1>

<ul>
     <li> All about virtualization
	  <ul>
	       <li> what is it that you're virtualizing?  Unet/MM:
		    virtualizing the NI.  VNTP/Myrinet: virtualize NI plus
		    adding performance through ILP of transport into DL,
		    but forcing reliability on you.
	       <li> end-to-end viewpoint:
	       <li> IP at user-level: demonstrated works if nothing goes
		    wrong (single peer-to-peer with no timeouts).  Nothing
		    really shown for high-contention, wide area, etc.
	       <li> usual ALF arguments against single uniform reliability
		    mechanism apply to the question of what should be
		    virtualized.
	       <li> Customization/ASHs
	  </ul>
     <li> Bottom line: usual tradeoff between generality vs. customization
	  vs. exposing details, and performance/effort tradeoffs.
</ul>
