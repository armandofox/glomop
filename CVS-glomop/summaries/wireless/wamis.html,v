<p><b>One-line summary:</b>
Vision paper for ARPA WAMIS, fully distributed heirarchical wireless network based on <i>clusters</i>, using TDMA within clusters and CDMA across them.
</p>

<h2>Overview/Main Points</h2>

<ul>
<li> Datagrams for "document" traffic, virtual circuits supported for continuous media
<li> Passive ACK doesn¹t work since SS-CDMA is used; hence need e2e as well as link-to-link flow and congestion control.
<li> <b>clustering</b> provides framework for CDMA code separation, channel access, power control, etc.
<li> TDMA used within a cluster. "Cluster head" (leader) elected by "lowest-ID" algorithm, which is more stable than "highest-connectivity".
<li> Routing within a cluster is fully distributed; intercluster packets must go through <i>gateways</i> that know both CDMA codes for adjacent clusters
<li> "Distributed gateway": a single logical gateway implemented across a pair of machines in different clusters that can hear each other.  Most useful in very weak connectivity situations, unneeded complexity otherwise.
<li> COdes can be reused in non-adjacent clusters by 4-coloring graph; since also need a code for control channel, system requires 9 orthogonal codes.
<li> Frame is divided into "Info" and "Control" phases.  During control phase, neighbors exchange a <i>lot</i> of data (eg power gain lists, connectivity info, code assignment, etc) using broadcast.
<li> Size of control frame grows linearly with number of radios in network!  Authors estimate 24 slots enough for a "typical" system whose properties seem to be pulled out of their butt.
<li> Fast-reservation for virtual circuits (to handle mobility as circuits move around): shortest-path assignments using Bellman-Ford algorithm.  No discussion of when to use fast reservation vs. the standard "static" scheme used in low-mobility situations.
<li> E2E thruput is lower than link thruput by about factor of 4 (simulation); why??
<li> Combined CDMA and TDMA yields 80 percent improvement over TDMA alone.  Not surprising.
<li> A few "blue sky" extensions to protocol proposed.
</ul>
<h2>Relevance</h2>
No need for wired infrastructure; the network sets up and deploys anywhere and can handle a variety of applications.

<h2>Flaws</h2>
<ul>
<li> Vision, not implementation paper; lots of stuff glossed over or  not explained.
<li> Complexity of combined TDMA and CDMA seems formidable, yet they don¹t address.  How much of this have they tried to build?
<li> Hands waved violently regarding how network can be synchronized for the TDMA part.
<li> Scalability is claimed as a goal, but the control-phase length seems to preclude this.
