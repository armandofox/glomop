<h1>
A Mobile Host Protocol Supporting Route Optimization and Authentication
</h1>
<strong>
Andrew Myles, David B. Johnson, and Charles Perkins
</strong>

<p><b>One-line summary:</b> This paper describes a variant of mobile-IP
that supports authentication and security levels equal to today's internet
security, and a migration path for strong authentication for the happy day
that key-distribution and management protocols arrive in the internet.  </p>

<h2>Overview/Main Points</h2>

<UL>
     <LI><B>Mobile IP revisited:</B> The infrastructure described
	  consists of the usual mobile hosts, home agents, local
	  agents <i>(aka foreign agents)</i>, and cache agents (
	  which are used to provide route optimization).  The protocol
	  spoken between these agents is called the Internet Mobile
	  Host Protocol (IMHP).  The combination of a mobile host's
	  home address and care-of-address is known as a binding.

     <LI><B>Authentication:</B> All updates to bindings must be
	  authenticated to thwart bad guys.  The home agent and mobile
	  host have a manually configured shared key, so strong
	  authentication is trivially possible.  Local agents give
	  mobile hosts temporary shared keys, so authenticated binding
	  revocations to old local agents are possible.  Local agents
	  also authenticate visitor list entries by verifying that
	  the home agent has a binding indicating that the mobile
	  host is visiting that local agent.  Local agents and cache agents
	  generate random numbers included in management requests to
	  home agents;  home agents include this random number in replies.
	  Thus, only hosts directly between querying agents and the home
	  agent can play tricks, which is the same as the current internet.

     <LI><B>Binding management:</B> Bindings in home agents, local
	  agents, and cache agents all time out, and must be refreshed
	  to remain valid.  Also, lazy invalidation of cache agents'
	  bindings is performed when an old, invalid binding is detected.
	  Furthermore, binding notifications are sent back to previous
	  routers when the unoptimized dog-leg route is detected, in the
	  hope that the previous routers implement a cache agent.
</UL>

<h2>Relevance</h2>

Security and authentication for mobile hosts would be very, very good.

<h2>Flaws</h2>

<UL>
     <LI> This paper doesn't deal with privacy or end-to-end encryption.
	  It is true, however, that these issues are orthogonal to
	  the authentication issues in the paper.
</UL>
