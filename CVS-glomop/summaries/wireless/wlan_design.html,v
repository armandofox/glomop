<h1>
Wireless LAN Design Alternatives

<p><b>One-line summary:</b>
The best fit for IBM customer needs is a WLAN using slow FH, 2.4GHz, and TDMA.
</p>

<h2>Overview/Main Points</h2>

<h3>
Customer requirements (determined by surveys):</h3>
<ul>
<li>Worlwide portable product
<li>Battery life
<li>License-free operation
<li>Transmission robustness <i>and security</i>
<li>Collocated networks
<li>Ease of management
</ul>

<h3>Physical layer</h3>
IR and RF are complementary, not competing:
<ul>
<li>IR suitable in small rooms
<li>Simple, cheap, unregulated
<li>Orthogonal modulation techniques can be used to isolate IR networks
<li>RF has wider range (outdoors) but subject to noise
<li>Worldwide demand for RF has created intense competition for spectrum
</ul>

<h3>Radio technology</h3>

<ul>
<li> Slow FH (chipping rate slower than data rate) vs fast FH: slower is cheaper (power, cxity) and relaxes hopping synchr. constraints
<li> Non-spread spectrum (NSS): requires license, except new U-PCS (1890-1930 MHz)
<li> Most PCS services will be voice-oriented; data services will be adequate for messaging, but will complement (not replace) WLAN¹s
<li> Cost impact of using high-frequency NSS: emerging technology (GaAs,Ge)
<li> Problems that don¹t exist in NSS, and are handled with more agility by FH than DS:
<ul>
<li> Interference with other systems in same band
<li> Collocation of networks
<li> Yielding to higher-priority users
</ul>
<li> ISM band: FH has best interference properties since 40% of channels can be thought of as "spare" for interference mgmt.
<li> BUT, high-freq (5.8GHz) ISM implies multiple semiconductor technologies to implement, hence single-chip xceivers unlikely anytime soon
<li> 915 MHz ISM already crowded and experiencing greatest market growth
<li> Only 2.4 GHz band is available worldwide
<li> So...we should use 2.4Ghz (its one vice: microwave ovens)
</ul>

<h3>Topology and MAC</h3>

Difference between contention-based peer-to-peer and TDMA BS-to-many-MH¹s schemes: Centralizing control in a BS allows
<ul>
<li> Air scheduling with knowledge of fileserver etc. needs.  With peer-to-peer, all traffic is "equal".
<li> Access to wired network for all MH¹s.  With p2p, need a dedicated gateway for this.
<li> Security management
<li> Traffic scheduling to reduce power consumption at MH¹s
<li> Can choose TDMA frame to be submultiple of FH interval.  In CSMA, must defer a message if it would "cross" a hop
<li> End user latency in TDMA scheduling may be higher under light load, but it is much less <i>variable</i> than for CSMA
</ul>

<b>Ergo, best design point is 2.4 GHz, TDMA, slow FH</b>

<h2>Relevance</h2>

A design point argument for WLANs based on fitting to customer needs.  Nice tables comparing the design alternatives for each component.

<h2>Flaws</h2>
Almost felt like the goals were presented in such a way as to force the conclusion; the fit is just too neat....
