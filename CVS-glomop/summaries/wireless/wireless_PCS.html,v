<h1>
Wireless Personal Communications: What Is It?
</h1>

<p><b>One-line summary:</b>
Wireless PCS is in a chaotic and transitionary state;  it will evolve
into two main classes - &quothigh-tier&quot systems that focus on highly
mobile voice communications, and &quotlow-tier&quot systems that
minimize cost, maximize the number of users per cell, and provide
voice and data capability.
</p>

<h2>Overview/Main Points</h2>

<UL>

<LI><B>Classes of PCS</B>: Messaging (voice mail, fax, e-mail),
paging (broadcast with no return channel), real-time two-way
communications, and &quotagents& represent broad classes of PCS.
These classes should work across different geographical scales, with
varying QOS.

<LI><B>Digital cordless</B>: CT-2, DECT - 32kb/s ADPCM, 10-50ms RTT,
4QAM modulation, time-division duplex are the common features of these
standards.

<LI><B>High-tier PCS</B>: high-tier PCS is the catch-phrase for
early digital cellular systems such as IS-54, IS-95, GSM, and DCS-1800.
Such systems are characterized by complex modulation and speech coding
techniques and large macro-cells on the order of 0.5-3.0 kilometers, with
the goal of maximizing both users/MHz and users per cell, implying high
power consumption, network complexity, and end-end latency.

<LI><B>Wide-area data</B>: ARDIS, CDPD, RAM, and now Metricom are
examples of commercialized technologies.  Typically such services
exhibit high mobility, low data throughput, and high latencies.  In
the face of low-tier PCS, the future of such services is uncertain.

<LI><B>WLAN</B>:  Very desirable properties, but currently unprofitable
in spite of severe commercial competition.  Two main designs include
centralized coordination and ad-hoc self-organizing LANs.

<LI><B>Low-Tier PCS</B>: Evolutionary trends are towards microcell
coverage for frequency reuse and low-power benefits, overlay networks
of LAN, MAN, and WAN wireless systems, low-complexity coding and
efficienct modulation, and FDMA or CDMA to relax time synchronization
requirements.

</UL>

<h2>Relevance</h2>
This paper gives describes the current state of wireless communications
and speculates on the future, from a telecommunications perspective.
The evolutionary trends presented are strongly argued and supported
with evidence, and the facts described are accurate without being
overly detailed.

<h2>Flaws</h2>

<UL>
<LI>Nearly all systems or other high-level issues involved with
wireless communications are totally ignored.

<LI>The future demand for high-speed data services that exhibit high
mobility seems to be underestimated;  wireless voice and paging services
are overemphasized.  (This is probably because the author is a
telephone engineer.)

<LI>Much speculation is stated as fact rather than possibility.
