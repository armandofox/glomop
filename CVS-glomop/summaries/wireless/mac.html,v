<h1>
Medium Access Control of Wireless LANs for Mobile Computing
</h1>
<strong>

<p><b>One-line summary:</b>
A dynamic multiple-access protocol will be the core of the design of a
MAC for WLAN's.  Background and goals for WLAN MAC standard IEEE-802.11
are described, and GRAP (Group Random Access Protocol) is presented as a
candidate for the standard.
</p>

<h2>Overview/Main Points</h2>

<ul>
  <li> WLANs can be either infrastructured (like cel network) or ad-hoc
       (like WaveLAN)
  <li> Downlink usually by broadcast
       <ul>
         <li> Need to build reliable multicast on top of it
         <li> When does a unit "wake up" from powersave mode in response
              to a broadcast?
       </ul>
  <li> Uplink requires a MAC--more difficult than MAC design for a wired
       LAN:
       <ul>
         <li> Dynamic channel characteristics (multipath, shadows, etc.)
         <li> PHY layer implementation (i.e. carrier sense is harder for
              wireless than for wired)
         <li> Mobility, dynamic NW topology
         <li> Handoff
       </ul>
  <li> Design Goals for 802.11 WLAN MAC standard: (there are 20; here
       are the less obvious ones)
       <ul>
         <li> Transparent to different PHY layers
         <li> Time-bounded (QoS) services
         <li> Fairness of access
         <li> Doesn't demand complex PHY interface
       </ul>
  <li> Some problems with existing MAC schemes for WLANs:
       <ul>
         <li> Throughput of ALOHA and 1-persistent CSMA/CD (Ethernet) protocols
              has unstable peak
         <li> CSMA/CA "useless" for WLANs since fades last several symbol times
              and RTS/CTS have high overhead
         <li> Polling has nice properties but too much handshaking overhead for
              BS's to keep track of roaming
       </ul>
  <li> Proposed solution: RAP (randomly addressed polling)
       <ul>
         <li> Upon receiving READY broadcast from BS,  MH's each send a
              random number on orthogonal (e.g. CDMA) channels
         <li> Do a few rounds of "random number exchange" until BS
              encounters a round with a "large" number of distinct
              random numbers
         <li> Assign channels to the MH's that transmitted those random
              numbers
       </ul>
</ul>

<h2>Relevance</h2>

Explains why a multiple-access protocol is needed for WLANs and why it
can't be implemented around conventional wired LAN design points.  GRAP
is not well explained, but seems to be based on relying on randomness to
get "probabilistic" multiple access

<h2>Flaws</h2>
<ul>
  <li> GRAP Requires orthogonal signaling for transmission of the
       random numbers!
</ul>
