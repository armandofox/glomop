Wireless Intraoffice Networks
</h1>
<strong>

</strong>

<p><b>One-line summary:</b>
Issues surrounding wireless communications are briefly presented, with
an emphasis placed on office deployment requirements.
</p>

<h2>Overview/Main Points</h2>

<UL>

<LI><B>Wireless overview:</B> All of the usual issues surrounding wireless
communications are presented, including benefits and difficulties, cellular
architectures, radio and IR propagation characteristics, frequency
assignment politics, wideband and CDMA vs narrowband, etc.  Virtually
nothing new is presented in the paper.

<LI><B>Issues regarding offices:</B> Integration of voice and data services
will be crucial, implying data throughput and latency requirements of the
wireless system.  Many &quottricks&quot like antenna diversity, effective
coding and modulation techniques, and the use of CDMA will be required.
Office environments adversely and unpredictably affect radio and IR
propagation.

</UL>

<h2>Relevance</h2>

Offices represent a potentially large customer base for wireless
technology.

<h2>Flaws</h2>

<UL>

<LI> While the article was technically accurate and succinct, there was
nothing new in this paper.

<LI> I gained very little perspective on the challenges of wireless
computing specifically in offices from this paper; the challenges presented
seem to be independent of office environments.  I suspect this article was
intended to advertise wireless technology in a journal that MIS people
read.
