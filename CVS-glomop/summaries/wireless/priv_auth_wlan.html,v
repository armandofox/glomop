<H1>Privacy and Authentication for Wireless Local Area Networks </H1>
<STRONG>Ashar Aziz, Whitfield Diffie<BR>
<BR>
</STRONG><B>One-line summary:</B> For seamless integration between wireless
and existing networks, end-to-end security is not realistic, so instead
authors propose a link-layer protocol by which machines (BS's, routers,
MH's) can authenticate each other and securely exchange session keys. <BR>
<H2>Overview/Main Points</H2>
<UL>
<LI>Goals: seamless integration; mutual authentication; design for future
advances in cryptography
<LI>Idea: machines exchange protocols and public keys, then exchange random
numbers to use as session key.  Thus <I>both</I> private keys must be compromised
in order to compute session key.
<LI>Generally, each message contains some stuff, and then the same stuff
signed by the sender:
</UL>
<OL>
<LI>First msg (challenge): MH sends to BS (in clear) certificate, nonce,
list of all shared-key cryptosystems (SKCS) supported by mobile.
<LI>Challenge Response: BS sends certificate in clear, chosen SKCS in clear,
Z={R1}pub_mobile, and (Z, chosen SKCS, original nonce, original list of
SKCS) signed by BS.  The signed piece authenticates this message as being
a reply to the first.
<LI>Mobile then chooses random number R2, and sends {R2}pub_base and ({R2}pub_base,{R1}pub_mobile)
signed by mobile.
<LI>New session key is R1 xor R2.
</OL>
<UL>
<LI>Requires 4 expensive (private key) operations; 6 if using Diffie-Hellman
key exchange
<LI>Key change protocol: exchange pair of authenticated messages.  Either
side can initiate.
<LI>With multiple CA's: BS needs to include certificate path and current
Certificate Revocation List (CRL) in message 2.  (What if BS is malicious
and delivers less-than-up-to-date CRL to allow illegitimate access?)
<LI>Proof of security using Logic of Authentication, except that fresh()
needs to be assumed for certificates modulo CRL's, since fresh() is required
to promote &quot;once said&quot; to &quot;now believes&quot;.
</UL>
<H2>Relevance</H2>
<BR>
How to do link-level security, given assumption that end-to-end will be
too intrusive to integrate seamlessly with existing networks.  (My view:
end-to-end will ultimately be necessary anyway for other reasons, but these
techniques can be applied there as well.)
<H2>Flaws</H2>
<UL>
<LI>Why not sign message digests instead of whole messages during the protocol?
<LI>Decryptability of data packets in presence of packet losses: can include
cumulative byte count in each packet header.  End-to-end would of course
fix this.
