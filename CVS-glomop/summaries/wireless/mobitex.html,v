<h1>
MOBITEX and Mobile Data Standards
</h1>
<strong>
Mobeen Kahn and John Kilpatrick, RAM Mobile Data
</strong>

<p><b>One-line summary:</b>
Overview of existing standards (there are so many!) for transmitting packetized data over unreliable RF links, with emphasis on MOBITEX, deployed by Ericsson and used by RAM mobile data.
</p>

<h2>Overview/Main Points</h2>

Existing wireline protocols (e.g. TCP) unsuited for wireless use:
   	<ul><li>tend to be "chatty"
	<li>assume predictable delays or congestion losses
	<li>extra overhead to support wide application range
	</ul>

<tr>
<td>Std</td> <td>Air IF</td>  <td>NW layer</td>  <td>transport</td> 
<td>comments</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>MOBITEX (Ericsson)</td>
<td>ROSI (GMSK), 12.5 KHz chs, CRC/Hamming, selective ARQ</td>
<td>MPAK (512 bytes, 24 bit addr); proprietary</td>
<td>MTP/1, proprietary</td>
<td>MASC interface: reliable data transfer (in-order?); most widely deployed today</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>ARDIS</td>
<td>Single freq reuse; 4.8 Kb/s (MDC-4800) or 19.2Kb/s (RD-LAP) in 25 KHz ch</td>
<td>?</td> 
<td>?</td>
<td>RD-LAP deployment limited.  ARDIS is one of only two nationwide providers.  Single freq reuse is economical (single switching gateway, many BS's) but limits capacity.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>CDPD (Baby Bells, McCaw)</td>
<td>19.2 Kb/s, FEC</td>
<td>Drafted as proprietary; changed to IP/OSI after pressure from software industry</td>
<td>TCP/OSI</td>
<td>pkt-switching overlay for analog cel voice network.  Since must operate within regulatory framework of phone companies, CDPD's must be modular, independent, interoperating networks.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>AMPS (cel modem)</td>
<td>Modulate data as voice at ~9600 baud; MNP-10, ETC, V.42bis for EC</td>
<td>None</td> <td>None</td>
<td>Must be able to stop/restart transmission after handoff or fade</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Metricom</td>
<td>FHSS, 902-928MHz (ISM) band, routing within radio mesh</td>
<td>proprietary</td>
<td>TCP/IP, AppleTalk via Hayes AT</td>
<td>Up to 100 Kb/s--NOT</td>
</tr>
</table>

Destineer (MTel): 2-way paging over narrowband PCS; 2 separate networks TDD'd onto a single 50 KHz channel.  Great use of a narrow slice of the spectrum, at the expense of response time.

<p>Migration Paths/Future:</p>
<ul>
<li> Gateways between proprietary and open networks
<li> Wireless extensions to AT cmd set (Portable Computer & Comm. Assoc.), already adopted by Metricom, Ericsson, others.  Allows existing apps a cheap (but inefficient) migration path to work over wireless.
<li> WinSock interface
<li> Microsoft Network Driver Interfaces Spec (NDIS), Novell Open Data Link Interface (ODI): standardize interfaces between app-layer protocols and MAC's
<li> Oracle client-server model for isolating client from dissimilar wireless devices; used by RAM Mobile Data
</ul>

<h2>Relevance</h2>
Overview of various packet-data standards, plea for standardization, overview of migration issues (primarily at the device driver level).

<h2>Flaws</h2>
Shameless commercial plug for RAM Mobile Data.
