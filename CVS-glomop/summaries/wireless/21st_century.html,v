<h1>
The Computer for the 21st Century
</h1>
<strong>
Mark Weiser
</strong>

<p><b>One-line summary:</b>
&quotMachines that fit the human environment, instead of forcing humans
to enter theirs, will make using a computer as refreshing as taking a
walk in the woods.&quot
</p>

<h2>Overview/Main Points</h2>

<UL>
<LI> <B>&quotPersonal computer&quot is a misplaced idea:</B> computers should
not be owned by people, but rather should disappear into the background framework.
The use of the computer should be unconscious - all attention should be given to the
task at hand.

<LI> <B>Ubiquitous computers come in sizes suited to tasks:</B>
<I>tabs</I>, such as active badges, perform calendar, diary, personal
identification and location, etc. tasks.  <I>Pads</I> are &quotscrap computers&quot
that are a merger of paper and laptop computers - they are the antithesis of
windows.  <I>Boards</I> serve as video screens, bulletin boards, whiteboards,
flip charts, etc.

<LI> <B>Architectural trends will assist ubiquitous computing:</B> CPU
speed, high-res display technology, auxiliary storage size increase,
etc. can be predicted to continue their current growth trends and enable
all of these classes of devices.

<LI> <B>Network, software and OS support will evolve:</B> migratory,
shared, and adaptive applications or OS's will need to be developed.  Gigabit
WANs, MAN wireless, and ad-hoc wireless LANs will become commonplace.

<LI> <B>The obvious security and privacy issues must be resolved.</B>

</UL>

<h2>Relevance</h2>
Mobile computing represents a major paradigm shift, replete with new usage
models and with technological and design difficulties to be conquered.  This
paper is prophetic;  whether or not Mark Weiser's prophecies will be realized
is anybodies guess, but the issues described in the paper are nonetheless
central to the future of mobile computing.

<h2>Flaws</h2>
This paper is more fiction than fact;  Mark Weiser tells a great story, but
readers should always keep in mind that it is merely a story.
