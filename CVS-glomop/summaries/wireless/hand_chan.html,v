Handover and Channel Assignment in Mobile Cellular Networks

<p><b>One-line summary:</b>
Commonly used handover strategies are described.
</p>

<h2>Overview/Main Points</h2>

<UL>

     <LI><B>Handoff:</B>  Handoff critical to an efficient system.  Handoff
	  related system characteristics include probability of blocking
	  new traffic, probability of forced termination, delay in channel
	  assignment, and total carried traffic.

     <LI><B>Fixed schemes:</B>
	  <UL>
	       <LI><B>Basic:</B> A permanent set of channels is assigned
		    to each cell.  &quotFull&quot cells imply blocked calls
		    and dropped calls during handoff.
	       <LI><B>Simple Borrowing:</B> If all permanent channels in a
		    cell are busy, unused channels can be borrowed from a
		    neighbour, assuming this doesn't cause interference.  A
		    calculation of additional cells now prohibited from
		    using the
		    borrowed frequency is performed.  In heavy traffic,
		    this implies degraded channel utilization.
	       <LI><B>Hybrid:</B> Permanent channels of a cell are split
		    into two groups - one can only be used locally, a
		    second can be lent to other cells.  Benefits of
		    borrowing but mitigates degradation by limiting extra
		    frequency prohibitions.
	       <LI><B>Borrowing with Channel Ordering:</B> Like hybrid, but
		    with dynamic variation of local-to-borrowable channel
		    ratio according to current traffic condition.
	  </UL>
     <LI><B>Flexible:</B>
	  <UL>
	       <LI><B>Flexible (Scheduled):</B>  Each cell has assigned
		    permanent channels.  The MSC (mobile switching center)
		    also has a pool of flexible channels that it can assign
		    to cells that need extra.  The assignment is done on a
		    scheduled basis according to known traffic
		    distributions over time.
	       <LI><B>Flexible (Predictive):</B>  Same as scheduled, but
		    assignment is done based on current measurements of
		    traffic intensity.  This rquires the MSC to have
		    current information about traffic patterns.
	  </UL>
     <LI><B>Dynamic (call-by-call):</B> All handoffs and call attempts are
	  refered to the MSC, which assigns frequencies on a case-by-case
	  basis according to a minimum cost function.  Again, the MSC must
	  have load information and radio channel measurements of MS's
	  (mobile stations).

     <LI><B>Handover decisions:</B> Made by both the MS and BS by
	  monitoring channel quality, or by MS alone.  The new BS is
	  determined by the MSC or MS.  Measurements must discriminate
	  against
	  temporary fades, but still react quickly enough to avoid call
	  dropping or interruption.  Policy may dictate that BS's accept
	  handovers with more priority than call initiation to avoid
	  irritating customers.  &quotGuard&quot channels may be reserved
	  for handover traffic, although this may decrease spectrum
	  utilization.

     <LI><B>Thresholds:</B> The <i>handover</i> threshold is defined as the
	  time at which a new BS's signal strength is greater than the
	  current BS's.  The <i>receiver</i> threshold is the time at which
	  the current BS's signal is too weak to be usable.  A MS must
	  handover during the interval between these thresholds;  handover
	  requests may be queued during this interval.
</UL>

<h2>Relevance</h2>

Handovers must be efficient and reliable in a cellular network;  this paper
explores common handover strategies.

<h2>Flaws</h2>

<UL>
     <LI> The paper is far more descriptive than analytical - it seems to
	  be a literature survey.

     <LI> Nothing is said about multicast handoff strategies - perhaps the
	  article predates this idea.
</UL>
