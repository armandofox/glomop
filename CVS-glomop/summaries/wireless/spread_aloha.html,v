<p><b>One-line summary:</b>
Spread ALOHA is equivalnt to CDMA with a common spreading code for all
users, so ALOHA techniques can be carried over to spread-spectrum systems.
</p>

<h2>Overview/Main Points</h2>
<ul>
  <li> Advantage to using a single code for all transmitters in a CDMA
       network, esp. for small cell sizes and multiple access satellite
       apps
  <li> Choice of a multiple-access protocol depends on traffic
       characteristics and state of the technology at deployment time:
       <ul>
         <li> DAMA (demand assigned multiple access): users request on a
              separate control channel; request protocol introduces
              delay and just moves the multiple-access problem to the
              (lower-bandwidth) request channel
         <li> DAMA w/random access: e.g. INMARSAT  uses pure
              ALOHA for request channel.  OK since allocation tends to
              be long-lived; no good if transmissions are bursty or
              short-lived
       </ul>
  <li> Multiple access protocols
       <ul>
         <li> <b>Slotted or pure ALOHA</b>.  Efficiency (r):
              eff. channel capacity divided by capacity of
              a continuous channel with same power & bandwidth.  For
              ALOHA, r=.18, asymptotically optimal for the special case
              of small values of thruput and S/N ratio.
         <li> <b>Spread spectrum</b>: max channel capacity in bits per
              Nyquist sample: C = .5 
              log (1+P/N) based 
              on Shannon & Nyquist relations. "Spread spectrum" means
              C << 1.
         <li> <b>CDMA.</b> Multiply channel signals by orthogonal set of
              spreading signals; multiply by cx conjugate at receiver.
              Requires multiple receivers at CDMA BS to demodulate
              received signal.
         <li> <b>Qualcomm CDMA (IS-95 std)</b>.  Spreading code is
              dynamically assigned via separate ALOHA channel when call
              request is made.  Up to 64 codes can be active at once.
       </ul>
  <li> We can choose same spreading code for all CDMA users and the
       channel will still have multiple-access capability (spread ALOHA):
       <ul>
         <li> Each subchannel's bits will be offset by a constant amount
              <i>g</i>
              from the previous subchannel's bits within the frame
         <li> With <i>k</i> subchannels, prob. that 2 bits will not
              overlap is (1-1/<i>g</i>)^<i>k</i>; then total traffic
              <i>G</I> = <i>k/g</i>.
         <li> Get the noise-immunity of spread-spectrum with the nice
              queueing properties of slotted ALOHA.
       </ul>
  <li> Previous studies: no compelling evidence that there is a clear
       advantage for multiple-code CDMA systems, despite their
       complexity
</ul>       

<h2>Relevance</h2>

We can get the noise immunity of spread-spectrum together with the
queueing behavior of TDMA, by implementing wideband CDMA with a single
spreading code for all users but offsetting the channel bit sequences in
time rather than by using orthogonal codes.

<h2>Flaws</h2>

It's not clear to me why the  "special case" for which plain old slotted
ALOHA is asymptotically optimal is an important special case.
