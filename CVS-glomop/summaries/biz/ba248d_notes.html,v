<h2>8/31 Bob Machlin, VP Corp Mkt, Ascend</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Mkt at Ascend: standard segment marketing--group similar buying patterns.&nbsp; (NB, not
    nec. similar products!)&nbsp; First PO from AT&amp;T was $50M, but it took 4 years of
    marketing.&nbsp; Most startups can't do this.</li>
  <li>Special partners have access to dedicated subwebs on main pages.&nbsp; Also extranets
    for resellers, etc. that aggressively push new screed.</li>
  <li>&quot;Carriers don't buy by looking at a webpage&quot; - they want to see and feel.
    &nbsp; Lots of direct/handholding marketing, live demos, etc.</li>
</ul>

<p>Interesting anecdotes...

<ul>
  <li>Fueled by success of the industry, investors who normally would invest in VC funds are
    now going direct to startups.</li>
  <li>&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
