<h2>8/31 Bob Machlin, VP Corp Mkt, Ascend</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Mkt at Ascend: standard segment marketing--group similar buying patterns.&nbsp; (NB, not
    nec. similar products!)&nbsp; First PO from AT&amp;T was $50M, but it took 4 years of
    marketing.&nbsp; Most startups can't do this.</li>
  <li>Special partners have access to dedicated subwebs on main pages.&nbsp; Also extranets
    for resellers, etc. that aggressively push new screed.</li>
  <li>&quot;Carriers don't buy by looking at a webpage&quot; - they want to see and feel.
    &nbsp; Lots of direct/handholding marketing, live demos, etc.&nbsp; Carriers are utility
    companies.</li>
  <li>Original proposal for Cascade: &quot;We're going to packetize the WAN and put all the
    big carriers out of business.&quot;&nbsp; Accel turned them down 4 times.&nbsp; When they
    got funded, went from $9M to $2B in two years.&nbsp; In comparison, Qwest raised $1B to
    start.&nbsp; Today: strong economic incentive to provide voice/fax over digital pkt data
    (two orders of magnitude cheaper).&nbsp; The big fish here is 800-number services.</li>
</ul>

<p>Interesting anecdotes... 

<ul>
  <li>Fueled by success of the industry, investors who normally would invest in VC funds are
    now going direct to startups.</li>
  <li>Get rid of your ego if you care about small companies.&nbsp; CEO gets out in front of
    customers all the time, rather than &quot;managing people&quot;.&nbsp; Mgmt is not the
    sine qua non of success anymore, understanding &amp; responding to customers is.</li>
  <li>Resellers don't really sell, they take orders and provide a place to store inventory.
    &nbsp; Thus, they're useless without a separate awareness campaign.&nbsp; Witness Cisco's
    recent commercial campaign: nothing about the technology, all about image.</li>
</ul>
