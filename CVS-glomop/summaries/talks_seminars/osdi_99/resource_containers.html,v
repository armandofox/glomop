<h2>Resource containers: A new facility for resource management in server systems</h2><P>
Gaurav Banga, Peter Druschel, Jeffrey Mogul</h2>

<h3>Paper summary</h3>
<ul>
     <li> Problem in OS: OS notion of protection domain and resource
	  principal coincide in the process abstraction.  Explicitly
          separate
	  out resource principal (unit of identity for resource management and
	  accounting) into resource containers, which can span
	  processes/threads/protection domains.
     <li> Solves:
	  <ul>
	       <li> lazy-receiver processing (LRP) - does much of the same,
		    but explicitly
	       <li> immunity against denial of service attacks like SYN
		    bombing
	       <li> much more effective virtual service separation
	       <li> clean, effective priority scheduling of tasks, rather
		    than processes (e.g. all things done on behalf of a
		    particular client, or CGI processing in web server,
		    etc.)
	  </ul>
</ul>

<h3>Questions from audience</h3>
<ul>
     <li> container not related to protection, correct?  correct.  Just
	  scheduling and accounting.
