<title>The Coign Automatic Distibuted Partitioning System</title>

<h2>The Coign Automatic Distibuted Partitioning System</p>
Galen C. Hunt and Michael L. Scott</h2>

<h3>Paper summary</h3>
<ul>
     <li> why distrib?  access to distributed resources:  people,
	  protection, peripherals, processors, memory....
     <li> problem:  distributed software must be decomposed.  How partition
	  and layout?
	  <ul>
	       <li> could do static partitioning: expensive to develop,
		    optimum is often user of data dependent, optimum
		    depends on net topology
	       <li> coign:  automatic partitioning for applications built
		    out of COM components.  measures inter-object
		    communication through profiling.  Partitions apps at
		    the COM level. Goal:  minimize distrib comm time
	       <li> roughly 40% overhead during instrumented profile
		    building.  semantically transparent.  profile
		    intercepts all COM calls.
	  </ul>

<h3>Questions from audience</h3>
<ul>
     <li> 
</ul>
<h3>Steve's thoughts</h3>
<ul>
     <li> Only applicable for those applications in which all data and
	  control flow is through the COM interface
</ul>
