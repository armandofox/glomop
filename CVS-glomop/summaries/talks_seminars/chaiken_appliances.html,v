David Chaiken, AT&amp;T Labs: "Information Appliances: News from an Emerging
Industry"</H2>

<H3>
April 21st, 1999</H3>

<UL>
<LI>
What's an appliance? Easy to use, hard to modify, well-known bounded utility.
Style more important than tech.</LI>

<UL>
<LI>
Info appliance: address book, email, web browser, toaster, ... .&nbsp;
Mediates access to electronic info.</LI>

<UL>
<LI>
E.g. Pilot.&nbsp; Not e.g.: personal computer</LI>
</UL>

<LI>
Devices developed at same time as new services</LI>

<LI>
Game plan: technology allows form and cost to match function; rainmaker
is person who leads; quick prototype - no research allowed; initial production
run; volume ramps, prices decline</LI>
</UL>

<LI>
Examples that Chaiken was involved with:</LI>

<UL>
<LI>
virtual book (1995) - research only, no production run.&nbsp; "Lectrice".&nbsp;
LCD was most expensive component, at about $5,000.00 for a 1024x768.</LI>

<UL>
<LI>
lessons: the web is the platform. packaging is important. standalone is
useful. huge market once cost threshold of $499.00 is beat.</LI>
</UL>

<LI>
internet terminal (IT, 1996) - business applications, low-cost desktop.&nbsp;
JavaOS port in 90 days.&nbsp; StrongARM processor at 233 MHz, but only
1 Watt.&nbsp; ISA-like bus, so PC components.</LI>

<UL>
<LI>
lessons: StrongARM crossed MIPS/watt, MIPS/$ thresholds.&nbsp; java works,
but not completely functional.&nbsp; customers: those looking to end the
personal computer nightmare.</LI>
</UL>

<LI>
SHARK network computer (1997) - business apps, low-cost desktop. 6 months
for prototype - production run by DEC, Uniden, Funai, ... . Open Firmware,
cheap parts, NetBSD OS (free and no GPL)</LI>

<UL>
<LI>
Lessons: larry ellison told the truth - $300.00 bill of materials.&nbsp;
Info appliances will distrupt PC's sooner or later.&nbsp; Form, function,
and cost aren't the whole story; Microsoft killed the project - coerced
DEC to drop it.</LI>
</UL>

<LI>
LaunchPad (1999) - form and function under NDA due to AT&amp;T customer.&nbsp;
"early adopter" at big company promised to buy 1,000,000 and give them
away to their customers if AT&amp;T could deliver for certain form and
function. AD7176 NTSC encoder, 2PCMCIA slots, serial port, led's for debug.&nbsp;
Runs Windows CE, soon to run linux.</LI>

<UL>
<LI>
<I>Steve's guess - set top box.</I></LI>

<LI>
Lessons: processor technology doesn't matter, OS doesn't matter.&nbsp;
form and function do matter.&nbsp; working prototype catalyzes ideas for
new forms/functions.&nbsp; Interesting problem: how to transform prototype
into volume product.</LI>
</UL>
</UL>

<LI>
Lessons</LI>

<UL>
<LI>
many traditional research areas not relevant to info appliances (high performance
computer architecture, high bandwidth networking, computer languages, OS
guts, file systems)</LI>

<UL>
<LI>
research that is relevant: HCI, authentication, distributed trust, SNS
construction and deployment, methodologies for transforming prototypes
into products (integration)</LI>
</UL>
</UL>

<LI>
Conclusions</LI>

<UL>
<LI>
technologies have crossed the relevant thresholds to admit info appliance
adoption by consumers</LI>

<LI>
necessary but not sufficient condition: form and cost must match function</LI>

<LI>
researchers in industry and academia must shift focus to stay relevant</LI>
</UL>
