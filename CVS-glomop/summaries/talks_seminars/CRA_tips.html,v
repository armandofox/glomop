<h2><a name="time"></a>Time management (Jan Cuny, U of O)</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Learn to say no.&nbsp; Keep a list of short &amp; long term goals, and evaluate tasks
    relative to those goals.&nbsp; Think about it overnight before committing to something.
    &nbsp; If you're not sure, ask a colleague if they think it's important for you to do.
    (Ex: graduate recruiting/admissions committee and other student-oriented activities are
    very helpful for new fac; colloquium chair is helpful for 4th-5th year fac.)&nbsp; Apply
    this within the context of research too: do you really need to build that big system or
    design your own foobar?</li>
  <li>Delegate.&nbsp; Consider work-study students, house cleaners, whatever.&nbsp; Do a small
    number of things really well.&nbsp; No excuse for mediocre job due to too many
    commitments.</li>
  <li>Schedule at multiple granularities, including (especially) daily.&nbsp; Forces you to
    guesstimate how long each thing will take and how overloaded you are.&nbsp; Batch
    non-movable things to avoid fragmenting.&nbsp; But don't overschedule or every day will
    feel like a day from hell; leave some big blocks (&gt;=3 hours) of uninterrupted,
    unstructured time, possibly at home.&nbsp; <strong>Helpful hint:</strong> once in a while
    write down &quot;what I did today&quot;.</li>
  <li>Get the important stuff done when your brain is still working.</li>
  <li>Be &quot;opportunistic&quot; and know yourself.&nbsp; E.g. if you prepare your lectures
    close to class time, you won't have to re-immerse yourself in them right before class.
    &nbsp; Don't start a paper overly early: if it's worth a week, start a week before the
    deadline, and let adrenaline help you focus.&nbsp; Know when you'll be burned out on
    classes and schedule guest speakers.</li>
  <li>Carry work with you everywhere and exploit idle time for email, etc.
    &nbsp; Psychologically, students don't like to come during office hours.&nbsp; Since you
    need to be there anyway, schedule something else to do during that time.&nbsp; (<strong>Corollary:</strong>
    if you're organizing a panel/conference or inviting a guest speaker, assume that people
    will use their travel time [and no more] to prepare for it.)</li>
  <li>Beware of email.&nbsp; Read it once, take action, move on.&nbsp; Don't let people get
    used to instant email responses or they'll become angry later.&nbsp; Beware of really long
    emails; they may be better handled by phone.</li>
  <li>If you have kids: parenting takes time--you can't squeeze it in between other tasks like
    you do with email.&nbsp; Get <em>great</em> daycare and get help from stay-at-home
    parents.&nbsp; Find out what's important to your kids--sometimes it's not obvious and you
    can end up spending well-intentioned effort on the wrong things.&nbsp; Maintain a sense of
    humor.</li>
</ul>

<h2><a name="ropes"></a>The Ropes for Assistant Professors (Bobby Schnabel, CU Boulder)</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Cultivate grad student relationships early (3-4 students by 3rd year).&nbsp; Be a
    researcher, not a research manager.&nbsp; Don't (necessarily) clone your advisor's
    methods.</li>
  <li>Teach 3 or 4 distinct <em>and diverse </em>classes, but not much more without a really
    good reason.&nbsp; On the other hand, err on the side of too few since you'll certainly be
    asked to do more.</li>
  <li>Who'll be writing your tenure letters?&nbsp; Service both inside &amp; outside dept.
    (program committees, colloquium tours, conference keynotes, etc.) are useful for making
    sure people know you and you know what's going on in your field.&nbsp; EECS has a fairly
    friendly faculty/research culture/environment; exploit it.</li>
  <li>Put your personal priorities in perspective, <em>and enforce them.</em>&nbsp; The world
    won't do this for you--they won't ask you to do less work and spend more time with your
    family.&nbsp; Conversely, nobody ever looks back and wishes they'd worked more and spent
    less time with their family, and nobody's tombstone says &quot;Got tenure at 30&quot; or
    &quot;published 100 papers&quot;.</li>
</ul>

<h2><a name="tenure"></a>Tenure Process: Publish or Perish? (Mary Jane Irwin, Penn State)</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Review levels: Dept Promotion &amp; Tenure; Dept Head; College P&amp;T; Dean; Univ.
    P&amp;T; Provost/President/Chancellor; possibly Board of Regents.&nbsp; Depending on
    institution/dept, some of these are hard and some are rubber stamps.</li>
  <li>Typical process: yearly oral evals by Head; periodic (maybe less than yearly) formal
    evals by some combination of Dept P&amp;T, Dean, Head; possible 5th-year written
    evaluation; 6th yr tenure review w/external letters.&nbsp; Some institutions also require
    external letters for earlier reviews.&nbsp; All written stuff becomes part of your
    Permanent Record.</li>
  <li>In publications, make your accountability clear: primary/sole author, supervising
    coauthor (your student did the work), coauthor, participating (&quot;tagalong&quot;)
    author, whether the publication was invited, etc.</li>
  <li>Choose your references carefully!&nbsp; Update references list <strong>yearly.&nbsp; </strong>Have
    them come give colloquia, speak at your classes, etc. Keep your research summary &amp;
    statement updated at least yearly.&nbsp; <em>Also keep a list of people in your department
    that you don't want to piss off.</em></li>
  <li>Your dossier is stateful!&nbsp; You want to show improvement trends.&nbsp; Address the
    deficiencies it mentions.&nbsp; Don't be ashamed to ask for department's help, resources,
    etc.&nbsp; Teaching the same course and showing improvement helps.</li>
</ul>

<h2><a name="rsch"></a>Selecting &amp; managing a research project/group (Stuart Russell,
UCB)</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Learn a new area.&nbsp; Sit in on courses. Visit people's web pages, read/review papers
    in that area, ask for advice and direction.&nbsp; Go outside your department, even.
    &nbsp; Don't be intimidated by complex topics/papers/notation/etc. and &quot;don't be
    afraid of the dark.&quot;</li>
  <li>Be able to justify end-to-end functionality (a/k/a applications?).&nbsp; Don't stop at
    the small well-circumscribed piece and assume that all the &quot;indirect pointers&quot;
    to the final application &quot;just work&quot;; talk to the people who actually care about
    the application and find out what they want.&nbsp; (This may be more applicable to theory
    than to architecture/systems.)</li>
  <li>Does your system/contribution have a <em>useful</em> property that's well-defined and
    either provable or empirically verifiable?</li>
  <li>Develop <em>taste</em> in choosing a project.&nbsp; Finish one and ask: what made this
    project work (or not work)?&nbsp; What made it fun?&nbsp; If some deliverables were unmet,
    why?&nbsp; Were they just too hard, irrelevant in retrospect, etc.?</li>
  <li>Need a medium/long term <em>theme</em> as well as short-term (2 yrs) <em>problems</em>
    with identifiable success/failure.&nbsp; If necessary, start w/something that seems easy
    to get early positive feedback (psychologically essential).</li>
  <li>Has someone had your idea, or a related one that supports it?&nbsp; (Ask colleagues,
    students, fac candidates, lit search, etc.)&nbsp; If not, does yours really make sense?
    &nbsp; Pick a concrete, simple, but <em>real</em> (not idealized) instance to work through
    a simple case that tests it.&nbsp; Then pick a tougher <em>real</em> instance to test the
    power of the idea.&nbsp; If that all works, figure out what resources you'll need to go
    forward (take classes, get students/money, buy special equipt, etc).&nbsp; <strong>Idea,
    someone else, simple case, tough case.</strong></li>
  <li>Don't get distracted!&nbsp; Keep your working set paged in!</li>
  <li>Don't get discouraged.&nbsp; A rejection from a good conference can be more useful than
    an acceptance from a mediocre one.</li>
  <li>Qualify students before taking them on.&nbsp; Sometimes they come to you with a great
    idea, or sometimes you need someone to work on a SWDYFORP (small &amp; well-defined yet
    fascinating open research problem).&nbsp; See how they do in classes (though that's only
    part of it) and ask your elder peers to assist with judgment if in doubt.&nbsp; Keep group
    small initially.</li>
  <li>Beware of students who turn simple tasks into complicated, intractable ones that never
    make progress.&nbsp; Conversely, watch for late bloomers.&nbsp; <em>&quot;</em>If you have
    a good student, just explain to them why something is confusing or hard, and they will
    come up with something brilliant.<em>&quot;&nbsp; Be able to say no (or cut your losses)
    even if they love your work, came to your institution specifically to work with you, etc.</em></li>
  <li>Meet weekly (group, project, individual), keep organized notes/minutes, be sure
    responsibilities/roles are clear, have measurable deliverables/interfaces/etc., plan for
    and track publication deadlines, <em>let students run the meeting</em>.</li>
  <li>Students need differing amounts of time depending on where they are in their careers.</li>
  <li>Design expts to <em>distinguish</em> your hypothesis from alternatives (not just to
    support it).&nbsp; Report negative/unfavorable results; these are often influential and
    heavily cited.&nbsp; (e.g. Michelson and Morley)</li>
  <li>Submitting bad papers can turn potential allies into enemies.&nbsp; Each really good
    idea deserves one paper that is as simple as possible.&nbsp; Ideal feedback: &quot;I wish
    I'd thought of that&quot;, &quot;This makes [problem X] seem trivial.&quot;</li>
</ul>

<h2><a name="funding"></a>Getting funding (Richard Hirsh, NSF)</h2>

<ul>
  <li>NSF accounts for about 1/2 of all Federally funded CS research (less in engineering,
    more in pure sciences). Promotes education as well as research.</li>
  <li>Personnel: ~60/40% permanent/visiting (2-3 years).</li>
  <li>Research directorates: Biology, CISE (Computer &amp; Info Sci &amp; Eng), Engrg,
    Math/Physical Sciences, Geology, Education.&nbsp; CISE subdirectorates are Computer-Comm
    Rsch (C-CR, the &quot;core computer funding division&quot;), Info &amp; Intell. Sys. (both
    pure research); Advanced Comp. Infrastructure &amp; Rsrch, Adv Netwk Infra &amp; Res
    (mostly infrastructure/facilities); Experimental &amp; Integrative Activities
    (infrastructure for depts &amp; colleges, as well as research).
    &nbsp; &quot;Infrastructure&quot;==big grants to get departmentally-shared resources,
    including equipment, staff, students to run it, software, etc.&nbsp; E.g. NOW.</li>
  <li>Faculty Early Career Development Program ($40-50k/year for 4-5 years): unstructured
    money to encourage development of full careers.&nbsp; Eligibility: recent PhD's within 4
    years of tenure-track appt; ~80-100 awards/year.&nbsp; Means you're not competing w/senior
    faculty!&nbsp; Emphasizes both research <em>and teaching </em>(may be a challenge for
    first-year faculty to make a strong case for this, but if you have a strong case, you have
    an edge).&nbsp; Apply early &amp; often!</li>
  <li><strong><em>Talk to your Program Director</em> </strong>-- don't just drop a proposal
    (or career-aware application) &quot;cold&quot; on someone's desk.&nbsp; If you're going to
    be in DC, call ahead and try to meet them in person.&nbsp; If impossible, <em>phone</em>
    them (don't just use email).&nbsp; Ask for <em>targeted</em> advice after presenting <em>specific</em>
    ideas and plans.&nbsp; Find out about related work (some of which they may be funding or
    reviewing).</li>
  <li>Read existing funded proposals to get a feel for what's required (rejected proposals
    aren't released).</li>
</ul>
