I assume it's not Intel super-duper secret  :-)

Subject: Hot Chip 94

DEC Alpha AXP 21164 (EV5)
- - 4-way issue superscalar, 7-stage integer pipeline, 9-stage FP pipeline
- - 0.5um drawn, 300 MHz typical, 40-50W, 9.3M transistors, 16.5mmx18.1mm
- - L1 dual-ported (instead of interleave), 2 loads or 1 load plus 1 store
- - Large on-chip L2 cache (96KB 3-way)
  - 6T SRAM
  - aggressive prefetch from L2 cache
  - 3 32B ahead of current issue
  - 2.4 word per cycle substained
- - Miss Address File
  - support up to 21 non-blocking loads (see Jouppi's paper)
  - 6 entries x 4 destination
  - 2 register fills per cycle
- - Direct-mapped external L3
  - 128-bit data bus, wave pipelined
  - up to 2 reads outstanding
  - using async SRAM, would have use BSRAM 
- - L1 is 32B line size, while L2 and L3 is 64B optionally 32B
- - Estimated Performance
  - > 1 SPECint92 per MHz
  - > 1.5 SPECfp92 per MHz
  - > 2 TPS per MHz


POWER2+
- - Take the POWER2, cut the memory bus in half (32B->16B) to get the
  pins to support a 16B interface to L2 cache by changing mainly the
  SCU.
- - High End Power2+ in MCM: 128K DCache, 32KB ICache, 512KB-2MB L2
- - Low  End Power2+ in BGA:  64K DCache, 32KB ICache, 512KB-1MB L2
- - L2 is direct-mapped 128B line using flow-through BSRAM
- - L2 is store-through (L1 is WB), parallel to DRAM (start L2 and DRAM
  at the same time.  Store-through makes sense considering the data
  hit rate is only 38% for 1MB L2 !!  This is mainly for instruction
  where the hit rate is 85%.
- - Everybody I talked to think this is not interesting -- IBM didn't
  change the microarchitecture by much (SPECfp92 actually reduced).
  On the other hand, this "simple" change improves TPC-C by 55% and
  TPC-A by 30%.  It looks like IBM had not looked at OLTP 
  applications when they designed the POWER2.
- - [PowerPC 620 probably has a 128-bit L2 bus.]

NEC 500MHz RISC Processor
- - If one can look past this not being a product, this chip looks at
  a number of interesting technical issues related to high clock
  rate CPU.
- - 8-stage pipeline with simple datapath control
  - no pipeline hold
  - instruction is only killed at the end of the pipeline, kill
    conditions are pipelined to the last pipeline stage
  - no register forward, forward in L1 only
  - minimize number of hold stage
- - 500MHz testing using self-test logic, setup and observate at low speed
- - 500MHz PLL with output jitter of 58ps and on-chip clock skew of 110ps !!
  [This is a small chip, a large and noisy die should be worse.]
- - 1V swing IO 

NCBUE3
- - 0.5um CMOS, 2.5M transistors, 345-pin CPGA, just taped out
- - Will be moving to IBM process (as every fabless house)
- - No L2, depends on SDRAM.
- - support 2 bank of SDRAM up to 100MHz.  [Bob Duzett said SDRAM is 50%
  premium now, 20% in the future.]
- - Estimate 50 SPECint and 150-240 TPS.  Either they knew someone in the
  high place (Bob assured me that nothing special from Oracle) or the
  TPS methodology was off (likely, they using single step to get their
  TPS trace).

Motorola MPC105 PowerPC PReP compliant chipset
- - 0.5um 4-level metal CMOS, 3.3V,
- - 358 C4 pad (otherwise pad limited) and 304-pin BGA
- - 247K devices, 6.2mmx5.7mm (39mm2), 2.6W at 66MHZ
- - single chip cach/memory/PCI controller, DRAM buffers for data bus
- - support direct-mapped L2 using BSRAM or async
- - use external tagram with reset and match
- - support self-refresh
- - support SDRAM for -1-1-1 burst (-3-3-3 with FPM)
- - show baby AT motherboard with PowerPC 604 booted NT

Sun Cached VRAM for 3D Graphic
- - Sun is all over the place on DRAM architectures for graphic.  Since
  Mitsubishi is doing this, this must be their top choice.  Sun is
  the one that proposed Window RAM that Samsung is pushing, but Sun
  is not pushing it anymore and Micron had backed off second-source.
  Sun has also proposed another multiple bank DRAM for graphic at
  JEDEC.
- - This put logic into the DRAM to make most operations like a pipelined
  write instead of the long latency read-modified-write.
- - 10M 3DRAM is about the size of 16Mb DRAM.
- - [Will try to get a data sheet and get a price estimate from Sun.]

Multimedia Enhancements for PA-RISC Processors
- - Rudy Lee presented their SIMD instructions that enabled them to do
  MPEG decompression in software at 30fps.  [On the other hand,
  CompCore showed a P90 running MPEG ddecompression at 30fps with
  the software written in C.  It is likely that CompCore may avoid
  certain types of frame.  CompCore did licensed that hardware
  technology to Cirrus Logic, Zilog, 3DO, ... ]  

PowerPC 604
- - Less information that the ISCA presentation
- - Get almost 2 inst/clock from one of the SPEC benchmark
- - Explicit "allocate" state in the cache to keep track of in-progress
  line

Metaflow Thunder
- - Silicon in Nov 93, have *not* boot unix yet, TLB circuit problem,
  ion milled fixed, but 2nd and 3rd silicon has VTI yield problem,
  waiting for the 4th spin of the silicon.
- - Will be moving to the 0.5um CMOS process from IBM by end of the year.
  One of the chips already tapeout to IBM.
- - Using the VTI process, it is 50MHz.  Using IBM process, it will
  be 80/100 MHz.  4-th layer metal help die size and speed.
- - Eager evaluation.  Handle single instruction eager evaluation,
  or more like conditional execution.  This is limited to the
  instruction in the delay slot that can be cancelled, or branching
  to skip a single instruction.  That single instruction is
  conditionally executed without a slot in the branch self.
- - Branch Prediction.  Using the simple 2-bit state approach,
  but suplemented with counter based prediction (claimed patent
  pending), return stack, and JMPL cache.
- - Still no on-chip Dcache design, use BSRAM L2
- - added bypass between FPU and IU, FP still getting attention probably
  due to background of founders. 
- - Support memory renaming.  Bruce off-handedly said this is important
  for X86 architecture and avoided clarification when asked afterward.
  In our earlier discussion, this is actually very important for SPARC
  too because SPARC does a lot of FP ld/st even a FP move may be better.
  Secondly, SPARC passed FP parameters using integer register
- - Metaflow's out-of-order speculative execution patents have not
  been issued yet, will let us know when they come out.
- - 80/100 MHz.  Claimed the associative lookup of the DRIS is not the
  bottleneck, the branch predicate and fetch is the critical path.
- - Too little too late.
