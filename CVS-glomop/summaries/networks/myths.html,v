<h1>
Myths About Congestion Management in High-Speed Networks
</h1>
<strong>
Raj Jain, DEC
</strong>

<p><b>One-line summary:</b>
Provides substance on both sides of several religious arguments on
congestion control, including open-loop vs. closed-loop, one scheme
vs. many, router vs. source, backpressure vs. explicit feedback;
concludes that heterogeneity of traffic and network types is making
congestion worse, and "one size fits all" will never work.
</p>

<h2>Overview/Main Points</h2>

<ul>
  <li> Previous myths exploded: Congestion will go away when buffers get
       bigger, WANs get faster, CPU's get faster, or all of the above.
  <li> Economic arguments for fast WANs:
       <ul>
         <li> high-speed means more sharing, therefore
              better cost amortization.  Analogy: highways (hi speed) connect
              cities (low speed), even
              though most traffic is local.
         <li> Today's data networks carry voice traffic as packets;
              voice networks carry data as coded voice signals.  This
              separation cannot persist because it is not economical.
       </ul>
  <li> Rate vs. window based congestion control: Rate-based should
       become more popular because 
              memory is no longer the bottleneck, because window based
              flow control is more susceptible to burstiness, and
              because much high-speed traffic will require rate rather
              than window guarantees.
       (One possibility: rate-based with fallback to a large
              window size, to be used in case of severe congestion.)
       <table border="1">
       <tr>
       <td>What</td><td>Window-based</td><td>Rate-based</td>
       </tr>
       <tr> <td>Control</td><td>Window</td><td>n packets every T seconds
       (most models incorrectly collapse these to single param L=n/T)</td></tr>
       <tr><td>Eff. rate</td><td>Window/RTT</td><td>n/T</td></tr>
       <tr><td>Required if</td><td>Memory is bottleneck</td><td>CPU,
       link, or rate-based devices are bottleneck</td></tr>
       <tr><td>Max Q length</td><td>determined by
       window</td><td>unbounded</td></tr>
       <tr><td>Burstiness</td><td>yes</td><td>not at source</td></tr>
       <tr><td>Controlled</td><td>end-to-end, hop-by-hop, or both</td>
       <td>hop-by-hop</td></tr>
       <tr><td>Network layer</td><td>Connectionless or
       connection-oriented</td> <td>connection-oriented</td></tr>
       </table>
  <li> Router- vs. source-based:
       <ul>
         <li> Arguments against source based: significant delays; sources
              may not cooperate; feedback may require additional packets
              to be injected (explicit feedback notification); fairness
              can't be achieved.
         <li> Argument against router-based: adds instructions to
              critical path of packet forwarding; congestion continues
              until sources reduce their traffic anyway.
         <li> Summary: use router-based to ensure fairness and  for
              short-duration 
              overload; source-based (and at higher network layers) for
              longer overloads.
         <li> Backpressure is a datalink level hop-by-hop on/off flow
              control that works well in small-diameter networks for
              short durations.  Unfair in that traffic following
              uncongested path can be adversely affected.
       </ul>
  <li> Reservation vs. walk-in:  Reservations good for steady,
       predictable traffic; walk-in 
              good for shorter, bursty traffic.
  <li> One scheme vs. many: need one, since congestion control deals
       with shared resources.  Rule of thumb: the longer the duration of
       congestion, the higher the layer in which congestion control
       should be implemented.
</ul>

<h2>Relevance</h2>

Collection of "revealed wisdom" about congestion control following
flurry of prior religious papers.

<h2>Flaws</h2>

<ul>
  <li> Most arguments, though intuitively satisfying, are qualitative rather
       than quantitative, though there are references.
  <li> Not a prescriptive paper; given all this information, and the
       existence of the heterogeneous wide-area Internet, what do we do?
</ul>
