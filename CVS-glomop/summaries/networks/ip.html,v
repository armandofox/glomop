<h1>
A Protocol for Packet Network Intercommunication
</h1>
<strong>
Vint Cerf and Bob Kahn
</strong>

<p><b>One-line summary:</b> Description, assumptions,
and justification for proposed design features of IP and TCP, given the
philosophy that the internetting protocol's goal should be to make
connection of heterogeneous networks as easy as possible.</p>

<h2>Overview/Main Points</h2>

The following IP "core
concepts" are introduced in prototype form:  (I use "IP" and "TCP" in
this summary, but the names hadn't been fixed when this paper was written)

<ul>
  <li> gateway and gateway routing based on source and dest addresses
  <li> TCP port demultiplexing
  <li> fragmentation and heterogeneous MTU's
  <li> end-to-end reliability
  <li> window based end-to-end flow control
  <li> end-to-end message reordering based on sequence numbers
  <li> building "logical" connections using connectionless network by
       exchanging initial parameters and maintaining state at each end
</ul>

Philosophy for an internetting protocol: make it as painless as possible to
connect heterogeneous networks.

<ul>
  <li> gateways should insulate networks from link-level addressing
       differences, MTU differences, performance differences
  <li> end-to-end reliability needed for hassle-free
       internetting, to hide varying reliability in different nw's
  <li> routing: next hop gateway should be "derivable from" source
       and/or dest addresses; in the section on TCP, they describe the
       predecessor to the masking scheme currently used
  <li> allow for nw's with different MTU's rather than
       enforcing a global minimum MTU, because:
       <ul>
         <li> want to isolate internal packet size parameters across
              network boundaries
         <li> encryption, associative addressing, etc might cause a
              "legal" packet to grow unpredictably larger than MTU
         <li> difficult to increase "global minimum" MTU (inertia,
              installed software base, etc.) to exploit new
              technology
         <li> Reassembly should <i>not</i> be done at gateways:
              serious buffering and state problems, plus
              requires all fragments of a packet to pass through same gateway
              (reduces flexibility in routing)
       </ul>
</ul>

TCP design philosophy: provide a process-to-process (not just
host-to-host) communication facility on top of IP.

<ul>
  <li> Goal:  demultiplexing of messages to different applications
       on a host.  Proposal: use 16-bit port number per "stream".
  <li> Interesting application: authors mention that if communicating
       parties agree in advance on a "port hopping sequence", could use
       for privacy by obscuring which messages belong to which stream.
  <li> Streams to different ports shoudl <i>not</i> be multiplexed into
       a single TCP-level 
       message, since this introduces artificial inter-process
       dependencies at receiving host (packet parsing, retransmission,
       etc.)
  <li> Routing: original proposal was that a "network address" be an
       8-bit network number plus 16-bit TCP port number.  Gateways
       demultiplex TCP port numbers to applications, but authors allow
       for possibility that machines in local network understand the
       internetwork addressing scheme.
  <li> Message reordering: use sequence number unique to pair of
       communicating ports.
  <li> Retransmission after timeout: "It is our expectation that
       ... [it] will not be called upon very often in practice";
       authors felt that IP would mostly be reliable except under severe
       congestion.
  <li> <b>Important.</b> Careful discussion of what a "connection"
       really is, in light of evidence (ARPAnet) that connectionless
       protocols can be constructed; derivation of the current TCP
       meaning of "connection" as shared state using a connectionless
       network as medium.  IMHO, a major leap of insight.
</ul>

<h2>Relevance</h2>

The assumptions and justifications for each design choice mentioned are
pretty well spelled out.  It should be possible to use this as a
"checklist" for design choices in IPv6.

<h2>Flaws</h2>

<ul>
  <li> IP and TCP not as well separated as they became after the OSI
       7-layer model was "imposed" on TCP/IP, though the paper does take
       care to keep routing and "connections" logically separate.
  <li> Sometimes
       ideas and concepts are presented, other times implementation
       suggestions or data layout. 
  <li> It's mentioned that packet accounting will be needed since data
       will be traversing networks of different ownership, but this
       point is never returned to in detail.  Current evidence seems to
       suggest it has been de-emphasized <tt>:)</tt>
