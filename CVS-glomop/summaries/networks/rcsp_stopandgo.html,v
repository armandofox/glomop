<h1>
RCSP and Stop-and-Go: A Comparison of Two Non-Work-Conserving
Disciplines for Supporting Multimedia Communication
</h1>
<strong>
Hui Zhang and Edward W. Knightly
</strong>

<p><b>One-line summary:</b>
Non-work-conserving disciplines allow traffic reshaping, which in turn can
mitigate burstiness within a network;  RCSP and stop-and-go are two related
non-work-conserving disciplines.
</p>

<h2>Overview/Main Points</h2>

<ul>
     <li> Traffic in a packet-switched network: several traffic
	  characterization models (fluid models, stochastic random
	  variables, etc.) all come to the same conclusion:  burst size
	  accumulates at each hop along a source to destination.
	  Non-work-conserving disciplines control this
	  &quot;distortion&quot; at each switch.
     <li> <b>(r,T)-smooth</b>: during each frame of length T, the total
	  number of bits that are transmitted by the source is no more than
	  rT bits.
	  <ul>
	       <li> Stop-and-go uses such a framing strategy
	       <li> Uses admission control to enforce property that at each
		    switch, the arriving frame of each incoming link is
		    mapped to the departing frame of the output link by
		    introducing a constant delay <i>theta</i>, where theta
		    is less than the frame size T.  Bandwidth is allocated
		    to each connection as a fraction of the frame time.
	       <li> Can prove that this gives you (r,T) smoothness
		    throughout the network (although paper doesn't prove
		    it).
	       <li> There is coupling between delay bound and bandwidth
		    allocation in this scheme - to have more flexibility in
		    allocating bandwidth, can use multiple frame sizes.
	  </ul>
     <li> <b>(Xmin, Xave, I, Smax)</b> model: Xmin is minimum packet
	  inter-arrival time, Xave is avg. packet inter-arrival time over
	  averaging interval I, and Smax is max packet size.
	  <ul>
	       <li> RCSP uses this model, although it is general enough to
		    use other traffic characterizations.
	       <li> Delay regulator and bandwidth scheduler are two
		    separate components in RCSP.
	       <li> Regulator assigns elegibility time to packet, and holds
		    packet until that time before giving to scheduler.
	       <li> <i>Delay-jitter</i> (DJ) regulator: elegibility time of
		    packet at a switch is defined relative to elegibility
		    time at previous (upstream) switch - ET(i) = ET(i-1) +
		    d(i-1) + pi(i-1), where ET is eligibility time, d is
		    the local delay bound for the connection from switch i
		    to switch i-1, and pi is maximum link delay for same
		    connection.  <B>DJ</i> Ensures traffic pattern at
		    output of each rate-controller is exactly the same as
		    traffic pattern of each connection at entrance to the
		    network.  (!!!)
	  </ul>
     <li> Framing vs. decoupling: both guarantee end-to-end delay and
	  delay-jitter bounds.  Decoupling gives more flexibility.
     <li> Admissions control:  F
</ul>
