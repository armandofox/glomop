<h1>
Packet Loss Correlation in the MBone Multicast Network
</h1>
<strong>

<p><b>One-line summary:</b> Losses on backbone or between NI and
receiving process are rare; the average loss event is a single packet,
but the average lost byte lives in a burst packet loss; most packets are
dropped close to the source. </p>

<h2>Overview/Main Points</h2>

<ul>
  <li> MBone is a two-level "mesh of stars".  Main backbone routers
       operated by long-haul service providers are connected by
       redundant unicast
       tunnel routes; each backbone router is the hub of a star of unicast
       tunnels to local mcast-aware routers.
  <li> Data collected by counting dropped packets for specific MBone
       sessions at multiple receiver sites, then comparing the loss traces.
  <li> Expected packet loss along a link:
       <ul>
         <li> Suppose A is a backbone router downstream of B, and a packet is
              seen at all 
              of B's regional routers, but not at any of A's.  Then the packet
              either got lost between B and A, or else every copy independently
              got lost between A and its regional routers.
         <li> If Na and Nb are
              the number of packets lost by all receivers downstream of A and B
              respectively, then Na-Nb is the number of packets seen at B's
              regional routers but not at A's, so the expected probability of
              loss along link AB is (Na-Nb)/(N-Nb) where N is total number of
              packets sent by source.
         <li> Applying this to the top-level MBone hierarchy graph based
              on the data collected, the
              inter-backbone-router links have expected loss
              probabilities  &lt;&lt;1% (except for a bottleneck link
              leaving UCB, which has ELP about 5%, and the transatlantic
              link from U. Maryland to France, about 6.5%).
       </ul>
  <li> End-host loss (i.e. loss in the network stack) was measured by
       correlating losses from hosts connected to same local mcast
       router, and found to be negligible.
  <li> Spatial correlation among receivers that simultaneously lose a
       given packet:
       <ul>
         <li> 47% of all packets sent were dropped by at least one
              receiver!
         <li> Temporal independence of loss is assumed.
         <li> Metric: if m is the number of receivers simultaneously
              experiencing loss, and M is the number of receivers that
              simultaneously lose a given packet, compute probability
              P(M=m).
         <li> Expected probability was computed for star (packet source
              is hub of star), modified star
              (packet source is  spoke of star), and "full" (spatially
              correlated, as in backbone example given above), in each
              case with 11 receivers (the number of receivers
              instrumented for data collection).
         <li> The distribution of M for "full" and modified-star
              topologies were closest to
              the measured data. These both have the property that if a
              loss occurs close to the source, all receivers will
              experience that loss, suggesting that this is a dominant
              MBone lossage mode.
       </ul>
  <li> Spatial loss correlation between receiver pairs: 
       <ul>
         <li> Average correlation coefficient varies between .271 and
              .666.
         <li> But, when the loss that is <i>common to all receivers</i>
              is removed from dataset, correlation practically vanishes!
         <li> Again, conclusion is that spatial pairwise correlation is
              rare, <i>except</i> for the effects of loss close the source.
       </ul>
  <li> Temporal loss correlation at a single receiver:
       <ul>
         <li> Solitary (single-packet) losses predominate, but
         <li> packets lost due to long burst losses constitute a
              significant fraction of total bytes lost.
         <li> Periodic losses seen every 30 seconds; a paper by Floyd
              and Jacobson is cited (<A
              HREF="ftp://ftp.ee.lbl.gov/papers/sync_94.ps.Z"><i>The
              Synchronization of Periodic 
              Routing Messages</i></a>) to explain it.
         <li> Compare: "The average file is small, but the average byte
              lives in a big file."
       </ul>
</ul>

<h2>Relevance</h2>

Many proposed mcast error control protocols recover by interacting with
nearby receivers rather than requesting source retransmission, so it's
worth profiling whether loss patterns make it reasonable to expect that
a nearby receiver will have gotten the packet if you didn't get it.
(Paper concludes that it is reasonable to expect this.)
