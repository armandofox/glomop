<h1>
The Cult of Information: A Neo-Luddite Treatise on High-Tech, Artificial
Intelligence, and the True Art of Thinking
</h1>
<strong>
Ted Roszak

<p><b>One-line summary:</b>

</p>

<h2>Overview/Main Points</h2>

The computer has gained cultlike status largely due to "brainwashing" by
the software makers, technocrats, and others who have a vested
(commercial or political) interest in seeing it succeed.  The
brainwashing has taken these primary forms:

<ul>
  <li> The "information society", "information economy", etc.  Shannon's
       work on information theory has muddied the meaning of the term
       from its original connotation of something like "semantically
       useful fact that fits into a larger context" to "anything you can
       encode digitally".  No one knows what information is, but people
       continue to believe that having access to more of it is a
       panacea.  Similarly "knowledge".
  <li> The confusion that computers somehow mimic what people do,
       leading to the AI prognostications of human-level AI by the end
       of the millennium.  This is reinforced through the
       misunderstanding by the public of such misleading statements as
       "computers never make mistakes" and "computers can perform
       computations much faster than a human".  Presumably this
       reinforces the power of the "technical elite" and is daunting and
       dehumanizing to "the rest of us".
  <li> The notion, completely unsupported by statistics, that being
       "computer literate" (whatever that means; it used to mean
       programming, now it can mean anything up to and including bad
       edutainment) is essential or even useful for the job market, or
       that it is a generally useful skill in the same sense as reading
       or writing.  In fact, "computer literate" people often end up in
       the computerized equivalent of mind-numbing minimum-wage
       temporary jobs anyway.  Computer literacy in and of itself solves
       nothing economically.
</ul>

Computers can be called a "mature technology" because they are now
creating problems as significant as those they solve.  This includes
concentration of power in the hands of the wrong people.  For example,
the stock market crash of 1987 was
triggered by programmed sell-offs; most money in the market today is
made not from the "real economy" (manufacturing, services, etc.) but the
"information economy", which is nothing more than the ethereal "derivative"
financial products that can only exist in a world where minute-by-minute
tracking of enormous volumes of data is possible.<p>


<h2>Relevance</h2>

<h2>Flaws</h2>

The book is riddled with technical shortsightednesses, occasional
misunderstandings about some aspect of computers' purported abilities
(misunderstandings not unlike those the author laments), and a view of
the computer science community that is far too shallow and simplistic --
a community of "freakish minority" hackers (author's quote) who, like
the huckster "data merchants", have been blinded to all but the Godlike
power they feel from programming, and have used the computer to supplant
real-life experiences from personal interaction (email) to creating art
to running simulated physics experiments instead of real ones in order
to provide clean, synthetic results that match the theory.<p>

The truth is that people have always been suckers for cults and
advertising and mass media, and have historically been sheep more often
than they have been independent thinkers, so what the author is pointing
out is ways in which the computer is just the most recent instance of
this unfortunate fact of life.  Like many inventions before it, it
"solves" some problem only at the expense of creating some new ones
(downsizing and a demoralized workforce; an artificial "paper economy"
in the stock market; an "underclass" in America's schools where many
disenfranchised students, disillusioned by the way in which they have
been introduced to computers, become technological refugees).  This
insight is the author's self-stated basis for the subtitle "Neo-Luddite
Treatise...".<p>

For all its flaws, the book makes important messages about the
large-scale social effects of the computer revolution.  Those of us who
would claim to care need to know what we're getting into.  Joe Bob says
check it out.
