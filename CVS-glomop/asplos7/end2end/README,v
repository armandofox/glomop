@Try to get end-to-end timings for fetching PS, distilling to richtext,
and firing up the richtext viewer (tcl).  The quantity of interest is
latency to view first page.

To do this:

- modify $cmd in fetch_render.pl as appropriate
- say 'server.pl portnum' to start the server somewhere
- say 'fetch_render.pl servhost servport' and start your stopwatch, and
  watch the screen
- stop your watch when the first page appears.  Strangely, subsequent
  pages will overwrite the first page on the screen....maybe some
  page-break directive is missing from the .rt file

Note that the server will also print how long the whole conversion took,
so you can get a bar graph that looks like this:

   Time->>
           ***********************

To time end-to-end conversion+transmission only (unpipelined):

- modify $cmd in client.pl
- say 'server.pl portnum ntimes' (ntimes will default to 5)
- say 'client.pl servhost servport'
- times reported on stderr at both ends.
