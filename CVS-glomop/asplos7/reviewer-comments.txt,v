Regardless of the recommendations, please state specific comments and
suggestions that can be communicated to the author(s).  To aid the program
committee's evaluation, please preface your comments by summarizing
the paper in the first paragraph, emphasizing (the author's view) of new
ideas and the evaluation of those ideas.  Then critique both the new ideas
and their evaluation, including the methodology.

Internet clients vary widely in both their hardware and software
capabilities and in their network connectivity.  Such variations are
dynamic.

A proxy (process) is placed at the boundary between strong
(i.e. server) and weak (i.e. client) connectivity.  It monitors the
quality of the network connection between server and client.  If a
server response is incompatible with the quality of service available
to the client, the proxy translates the data into a form which
requires fewer resources.  Examples of such transcodings include
reducing resolution and color space and converting Postscript to HTML
or a "rich text" format.  The authors measured the latency and size
reductions for transcoding text and images and simulated the effects
of bursty document accesses to simulate load on the proxy server.

One advantage of this method is that document servers target only the
most capable clients and are not aware of any proxy.  Less capable
clients communicate with servers via the proxy, which makes optimal
use of available resources.

This is a clever solution to the problem. It seems to work best if the
client has a slow connection to an intermediate service provider where
the proxy can execute. Whether this approach is superior to strategies
that have the client and server negotiate/discover end-to-end
properties of their communication is not clear (except for the obvious
support for legacy servers).

The authors have taken an effective approach in leveraging
existing applications for image processing (e.g. netpbm).  The
"rich-text" transcoder, which was also developed by the authors, is
less interesting or perhaps less well motivated in the paper.

Given that they have developed a good prototype, I would like very
much to see need more (real or simulated) measurements and simulations
of full-system behavior at high load.  That is, some combination of
the measurement of the individual trancodings and of the behavior of
the proxy under bursty load.  The paper doesn't give me a feel for the
end to end performance as experienced by the user, which might be more
interesting.

The section on security seems somewhat confused, perhaps it is best
just left as an open issue.  Ditto Java.

The fundamental idea is very clever and worth publishing and has 
many obvious relevant applications.

My overall impression was that the work is interesting, but that
there is still a little more work to be done.

However, the paper doesn't seem especially appropriate for the ASPLOS
conference.  In my opinion, it would be much more successfully
directed toward a networking, multimedia, or WWW conference or toward
a more general conference.

Summary:

This paper presents a system architecture in which clients of varying
hardware, network, and software capabilities can access data from
remote servers which know nothing of the details of those clients.
Interposed between the clients and servers are proxies which {\em
distill} high-quality, demanding, data into a representation
that meets the client's networking, hardware, and software abilities.
This distillation -- and later refinement of the data if requested by
the client -- is done on a per-data-type basis.  They've examined
still picture data, postscript, HTML, and video streams as candidate
data types.

The central claim is that this is the first system to do so, rather
than one of four less attractive alternatives.  They also show that
such distilliation can, for many data types, be done on the fly with
acceptable additional latencies; for clients connected via slow links,
the end-to-end latency is often reduced.  They claim that such
distilliation is dynamically adaptive to changes in client needs or
network quality.  They have run trace-driven simulation to examine the
scalability of their proxy's distilliation of images.

Comments:

I liked the core of this paper very much: the idea is interesting, and
the notion that some awareness is required of both the type of data in
question, and the clients needs with respect to that data, seems like
the right idea to me.  The authors show that such real-time,
on-the-fly distillation is possible for most data types they've
examined.  For their central domain -- clients with poor connectivity
at the outskirts of an otherwise well-connected fabric -- they show
that end-to-end latency is indeed reduced in at least some cases.
Overall, I think this paper contains ideas interesting enough to
warrant inclusion in the conference.  While I have several suggestions
for improvement, I believe that the central ideas are sound, and that
the improvements can be made easily.

My highest-level comment: the paper tries to say too much, and in the
process doesn't make some of its points as well as it might.  The best
example of this is the discussion of dynamic adaptation to changing
network conditions.  The authors vaguely describe the Network
Connection Monitor, which they claim is responsible for measuring and
responding to network performance.  However, they do not describe how
such monitoring takes place, nor provide any evaluations of how well
it manages to perform.  At the minimum, a citation to some other
document describing this is required.  While I would prefer to see
more detail on this, it seems to not be central to the goal of the
paper; the authors and committee members will have to decide how best
to sharpen the focus of the paper.

The second example of this is the discussion of the parameters that
the proxy provides to clients with which clients may tune
distilliation to their needs.  While some of these parameters are
alluded to in the text, it is difficult to tell what the entire set of
parameters are -- a table describing them, with perhaps some
discussion that explains whether the authors feel that set to be
complete would be very helpful.

My final comment has to do with the experimental validation.  I was
very happy with the evaluation of the costs of distilling images to
various formats; several images were chosen, they had a reasonable
coverage of the space of possible images, and each were distilled to a
number of different formats.  I would recommend the authors apply the
same rigor to the distillation of PostScript and video; it appears
that only one PostScript document, and two video streams, were chosen
for experimentation.  This is insufficient.  In the same vein, the
authors show end-to-end latencies for clients connected via 14.4Kbd
modem for images, but 28.8Kbd and ISDN for PostScript.  Why not the
whole range for each?  It would be *most* interesting to see when
distillation pays and when it doesn't for each datatype.

The authors motivate and propose a grand architecture for adapting
network services to the widely varying capabilities of clients. The
architecture depends on transcoding proxy servers that, for example,
transparently convert a color image into a grayscale image that is
usable by the client.  The authors implemented proxies for transcoding
images, video, and PostScript files and present a performance
evaluation. The problem I have with the paper is that I'm left with a lot of
unanswered questions. For example:

 - no detail is given on how one "distills" a video image; is there some
   intermediate format I'm suppose to know about, or is this an NxN solution.

 - how does the NCM calculate network latency, which can be highly variable;
   what are the qualitatively significant thresholds?

 - how do a proxy know which output type best matches a particular set of
   constraints?

 - there are lots of grand claims (e.g., cut latency in half) but I don't
   see a well explained performance study.

In short, the idea is well motivate, the architecture is ambitious,
and some example proxies have been implemented, but I see nothing here
but a lot of programming; no unifying principle and very little
"system" (unless it's NxN solves all).  I'm also concerned that this
is really a software paper, with very little relevance to ASPLOS.
Perhaps the paper is better suited for SOSP, OSDI, or one of the
mobile computing conferences.

Some specific comments:

 - Section 2.4: there is an extra "using" in "using maintains a statistical".
 - The caption for Figure 1 mentions a distillation time of "about 6 seconds"
   yet Table 3 seems to suggest a time on the order of 20 seconds.
 - Section 3.1.2: "information" misspelled as "infomation"
 - Table 5: I don't understand how to interpret the numbers in row
   "First Page Latency".
 - Section 3.3.2 refers to "the following Table"---the table follows on
   the *next page*!
 - Section 3.3: "non-linearly" should be "non-linear"
 - There are an awful many self-references in the paper (both direct and
   indirect) which make authorship obvious.

Regardless of the recommendations, please state specific comments and
suggestions that can be communicated to the author(s).  To aid the program
committee's evaluation, please preface your comments by summarizing
the paper in the first paragraph, emphasizing (the author's view) of new
ideas and the evaluation of those ideas.  Then critique both the new ideas
and their evaluation, including the methodology.

This paper discusses a (software) system that is interposed between
a network "document server" and a client.  The purpose of the system
is to "trancode" the documents provided by the server to suit the
resources available to the client (bandwidth, screen size, CPU, etc.)
by doing such things as changing image resolution or color depth, or text
encoding (e.g., from postscript to html).  This is done in an agent running
on a node connected by wireline network to the server (and perhaps by
wireless network to the client).  The agent performs "N-to-N" transcoding,
i.e., there is no standard intermediate representation (for reasons of
efficiency in many specific encoding pairs).

Evaluating this paper poses several fundamental questions.  These,
along with my suggestions for answers, are:

	1.  Is this work scientific research?

		No.  There are no new principles proposed here, nor
		any comparative evaluations of any generality.

	2.  Is this work engineering research?

		Maybe.  The paper describes a particular system, and
		provides some amount of discussion for why the particular
		design decisions are appropriate in this setting.  (However,
		as just mentioned, the design decisions strike me as modestly
		new examples of old, well-discussed choices.)

	3.  Is this work interesting?

		Yes. It desscribes an approach to a problem that I think is
		of significant practical importance.  (However, it also
		strikes	me as very likely that most people when confronted
		with the problem addressed here would make essentially
		identical choices, even without the benefit of reading this
		paper.)

	4.  Is this work relevant to ASPLOS?

		No.  (In fact, the topic seemed so far from the model I had
		of scope of ASPLOS that I reread the CFP to see if there were
		something in it to suggest to the authors that ASPLOS was
		a suitable venue.)

My summary recommendation is based largely on the answers to the first two
questions above.

To clarify a bit my answer to question 3, let me say that this seems
like a very competent job, and that there are probably few groups in the world
with the background and skills required to produce as good a system with
reasonable effort.  This, and the fact that the topic is in an area of
explosive interest, means that this work will undoubtedly have wide impact.
However, I don't personally believe that this is sufficient for a research
paper:  the paper should have some research result as well.

To better clarify what is potentially my ureasonable bias on this topic,
let me say what I think would have made a paper.  I think it's evident that
some transcoding is required to deal with the variability of client resources.
I think the architecture of this system is also reasonably compelling (and
so evident).  What isn't evident, though, is the extent to which different
transcoding techniques (or compression severities) will prove to be acceptable
to the clients.  This is a perceptual issue, and so it seems to me can be
answered only through experimentation.  To perform these experiments, one
needs a system such as this; in that sense, the system could serve as a
vehicle to answering this important question.  However, the work contained
here is simply a description of the system (as well as some discussion of
design choices).  I don't think this is sufficient for a conference of
ASPLOS's standing.

ideas and the evaluation of those ideas.  Then critique both the new ideas

This paper describes methods for a web server to deal with clients
with widely differing capabilities over networks with a wide range of
available bandwidths.  Clients may differ in computing power, in
memory, and in the network connectivity to the server, and it would be
useful to tailor what is sent from the server to the client's
capabilities.  With transcoding,  the server's output is filtered
through a proxy, which translates it into a form that suits the
client's capabilities.  The proxy runs on a separate machine near (in
network terms) the server.

I liked this paper and would love to try it out.  The combination of
distillation and refinement seems like a great way to handle client
variations.  My main reservation is that it's really a software paper.
It would exactly suit a web or distributed computing conference.  A
second concern is that this approach requires a lot of hardware
between the clients and server.   The authors should discuss how much
is required and whether it is worth the cost.

I wish this work were more fully developed. An integrated system would
be good to see, and make for a compelling demo.  But I think there is
enough along for a conference paper

Detailed comments.
What is the nature of the simulation that gives the data in Figure 6?

The abstract needs to give more context.  What is transcoding?  If the
abstract uses the word, it needs to define it. The abstract should
also state the problem you are trying to solve more clealy.  When I
read "reduce the impact of . . . variation among network clients" I
thought you were somehow going to cause them to have the same
functionality, which isn't the point at all.

This paper presents a software architecture for control of server to client
bandwidth through proxies.  A proxy is capable of transcoding between
representations, is specific to a particular data format, and is aware of
the abilities of the client and the state of the network connection between
the client and the proxy (the connection between the server and the proxy is
assumed to be of high quality).  The key advantages claimed by the authors
include: reduced latency, client specificity, dynamic adapatation to client
interests, good compression due to datatype knowledge, and dynamic
adaptation to network conditions.

Overall the paper is very well written and supports its claims quite well.
The question of security is paid lip service at best.

The big question is:  What does this have to do with ASPLOS?  In my opinion,
the answer has got to be nothing.  The only architecture here is the notion
of a proxy, which is not what the Architecture in ASPLOS means.  I think
that ASPLOS is an inappropriate forum for this paper.

Nit picking:
  The discussion of delivery classes is too generic and high level to be
  informative.  What are the delivery classes?  Why these ones?  How
  flexible is this mechanism, really?

  Middle of 2.4 "using maintains a statistical model" is part of something
  that is not a sentence.

  same paragraph "below in Section 2.2" should be "above"

  Table 6 seems to be "lost" in the middle of the wrong page..

  The labels on figure 5 are incorrect in the text (figure 2d)

This paper proposes to insert software "transcoders" between network
clients and servers that match client resources to server images or
documents by translating the format of the images on-the-fly.  The transcoding
is actually performed by a third-party proxy.  Although the insertion of
this transcoder into the data stream increases latency, the authors
claim that end-to-end latency (as seen by the client) is reduced,
since the transcoder is able to use data-specific knowledge to achieve
higher compression.

The problem addressed by this paper either is, or
soon will be, of considerable importance.  It is less clear that
ASPLOS is the right venue, although we have certainly seen stranger
subjects in past ASPLOS proceedings.  Ignoring the issue of
appropriateness, this is a well written paper with interesting
results.  The specific examples of transcoding support the authors
claims.  An unanswered question is the feasibility of generalizing
this approach in some way, or are we stuck with a grab-bag of
transcoders that need to be modified or added to every time we
introduce a new protocol (or impriove an existing one)?

This paper would be strengthed by the inclusion of more principle vs.
system description, and by some discussion of user perception of how
well these techniques work.  I'm not at all sure how to go about the
latter, but it seems an important question.



==== Some comments from James Landay ====


Near the end of sec. 2.2 you say "if the NCM now informs the proxy that
the effective client bandwidth" has dropped.  Might you also need to
inform the client?  Say it has to know how to deal with a lower frame
rate or something (for this example the "stateless" protocols may handle
it, but I would think the client may need to know in some other cases.)

I found Section 2.4 to be quite confusing.  First, if you keep that
title it should be "Proxy-Aware Client Applications" rather than
"Application".  But I am not sure that is the right title for what you
describe. The section seems to be about the interface that
applications use to inform the proxy of proper distillation
constraints.  I would change the title and at least the opening of
that first sentence: "The client application understands..."

I found table 3 to be confusing.  It wasn't clear if the size and
times for the "map to gray" and "convert to pict" columns were just
for the stated operation or are they cummlative totals. In addition,
was "convert to pict" only running after "reduce to" and "map to" or
just "reduce to"?  This needs to be clear in the caption and column
headings.

In the 3.1.1 where you describe the table data, you state:
 "More aggressive color quantization actually takes less time".
Than what?  Less aggressive quantization?  Reduction in size?  You
don't say which and it is therefore ambiguous.

Below this you state that "transcoding to PICT adds virtually no
latency"?  This is related to my question about the numbers above.  It
looks like it adds 2.66, 3.73, 5.7, 6.75 (adding anywhere from 50 to
90% on the numbers for reducing the size.)  That looks like a lot, so
I'm not sure what this means... Or do you mean compared to doing no
transcoding at all?

Near the end of sec. 3.1.2 you say "The PostScript distiller will
support..."  Does that mean the refinement for PS doesn't exist?
Unclear from the rest of the paper.  In the next paragraph you say
that the distiller produced HTML that was 6.8% of the orginal PS size.
You should say if the original PS had "images" and how big they were.
Finally, the last bit you say about "A more usueful metric" was
already said in the end of "Network Variation" above.  It is
repetitive.

Finally, I tried to get your proxy to work and it didn't come up.

I hope these comments are in time to help out.

James


small corrections/clarifications:

- table 1: get the 1280x1024 to fit on one line
- table 2: "-20 ms" -> "- 20 ms"
- table 2: where is the variance in roundtrip time for wireline modems? ~200ms
- table 2: blank line after the caption
- those ugly arrows for indented paragraphs didn't seem to be used
consistently...
- end of sec. 1.1: "classes client variations" -> "classes of..."
- end of sec. 1.1: "performances of" -> "performance of"
- end of sec. 1.2: "where it can trade abundant CPU..." - this sentence is
  awkward and confusing. "Trade" seems to be the wrong word.  Maybe "offload"
  or "use" (with more work at the end of the sentence)?
- 2nd para of 2.4: "using maintains" -> "using"
- 2nd para of 3.1.1: "with a three" -> "with three"
- Table 4 and 5 are in the wrong order
- Table 5: "ISDN/28.8K" -> "ISDN / 28.8 K modem"
- caption of Figure 4 gets cut off.
- sec. 3.2.1: "are allowed . In this way" -> "are allowed. In this way"
- sec. 3.2.2: "stream to pixel domain" -> "stream to the pixel domain"
- you refer to figure 7 (tradeoffs in video distillation) before figs 5 & 6.
  Make figure 7 first.
- sec. 3.2.2: "zoom in a part" -> "zoom in on a part"
- sec. 3.2.2: "The following table shows" ... which table? Just say "Table
X shows"
- sec. 3.3: "running on single" -> "running on a single"
- sec. 3.3: "is uniform black" -> "is uniformly black"
- figure 5 caption: "column represents" -> "column in a square represents"
- figure 7 is totalled and therefore I couldn't read it or caption to see what
  it really showed.
- Table 1 right before section 4 should be Table 6.
- sec. 4.2: "Wireless networks suffer from high variablility to..."
  High variablility of what? Latency? Bandwidth? network characteristics?
  Say so...
- I found the sentence at the end of the above paragraph to be awkward.
- sec. 4.3: "(e.g. ..." -> "(e.g., ..."  (in several places, also with "(i.e." )
- sec. 4.3: "previously-described" -> "previously described"
- sec. 5.1: "invoking on objects" -- invoking what on? procedures? functions?
- sec. 5.3: "In contrast, the client-side application support library..."
  indicate more clearly that this is your stuff... "In contrast, our client..."
  (or something like that)
- sec. 5.3 above sentence: "required at any server" -> "reqiured to any server"
- sec. 6.1: "bases" -> "basis"
- Bibliography: it looks weird to replace Patterson with "D.A.P. et al." Either
  get rid of him and make it "et al." or put him in all the way
- Bibliography: can you give a date, page no., or URL for ref #18 by Brooks
- Bibliography: no blank line after ref #28 (Fox, Brewer)
