@STUFF TO DO

Things with ** are thought to be central to paper and must be presented
as such.

Things with ++ were said by more than one reviewer.

BIG THINGS

- need to convey that NCM and distill parms are problems that are (a)
central to research, (b) difficult, (c) likely to admit solution based
on our experience so far.  that's why they are "fuzzy" in this paper-
NOT because they are secondary importance.

** NCM: need at least a paper reference? but there is no paper!
  - check out what is implemented, see if it even works
  - describe concretely how NCM works>?
  - need to make explicit that this is central to the work

** more specific info about distillation parms
  - image browser?
  - neural net?
  - state problem rigorously as an optimization problem? (& explain use
  of automated stat. modeling)
  - at least mention how done for GIF, and point out that it would be
  useful to encode "effective bpp" in original img format! do other fmts
  do this?

++ research content

SMALL THINGS

++  (AF) text distillation: need stronger conclusions (minimum), or
 more examples (as for images)
 - reviewer: "It would be *most* interesting to see when
 distillation pays and when it doesn't for each datatype."

++ (EA) video: evidently, need clearer explan. of DCT intermediate form, and
  more results/examples.   

++ (AF) some measure of performance as perceived by end user
  - demonstrate upper bound on seeing a page w/thumbnails when using proxy?
  - how to improve the end-to-end latency graphs that are in there now

- (AF) relnship to C/S e2e strategies
  - admin @@ server, wide range o'clients
  - can compose w/e2e strategy eg odyssey
  - if serving many clients, single server can't scale to provide "all"
  representations clients want

- (AF) clarify intermediate format vs. NxN for text, images.
   - separate transcoding architecture from protocol architecture; show
   that we don't need to add "transcoders" every time there is a new
   protocol, just need "document parsers" and "document fetchers" for the
   new protocol.


- (SG) reviewer: "This [investigating extent to which different transcoding
techniques will prove to be acceptable to clients] is a perceptual
issue, and so it seems to me can be answered only through
experimentation.  To perform these experiments, one needs a system such
as this; in that sense, the system could serve as a vehicle to answering
this important question.  However, the work contained here is simply a
description of the system (as well as some discussion of design
choices)."  user's perception of "quality": nontrivial to predict, other
work exists [cite], this system will undoubtedly be affected by it, but it's
not central to *our* research.

- (SG) better description of simluations

- abstract: When I read "reduce the impact of . . . variation among network
clients" I thought you were somehow going to cause them to have the same
functionality, which isn't the point at all.

- (SG) delivery classes: as we did at retreat; describe as an optimization.

- (AF) need an "implementation" section:
  - GloMop apps: gmproxyd, gmwish, image browser
  - unmodified apps
  - image browser

- (SG) security: charon pointer


Some of Armando's ideas from before the reviewer comments arrived:

RELATED WORK

   - Cite Mowgli
   - point out that caching is (and should be) orthogonal
      to our system (eg Harvest)
   - Cite Bruce Zenel's stuff at Columbia.  For my summary of it (and
   what's different), see
   http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~fox/summaries/glomop/zenel.html
