I removed support in libpcap for FDDI since it seemed to require
some platform specific defines that I didn't feel like messing with
right now.  tcpdump has the appropriate code I believe.

New invocation syntax is:
	ipse tcp=23,110:::xpacketwatch -- "<BPF filtering expression>"

What to do about filtering?  BPF works but isn't integrated fully into
ipse which still needs to know how to deal with the packets it's given
by libpcap.  Splits up the packets into logical TCP streams and thus
needs to know the PORT specified in "ipse" syntax unless we parse it
out of the BPF syntax.

******* 4-22-97 kaminsky

Removed packet.c (basically did what libpcap does now)
Fixed all of the files to use the (seemingly) more standard references 
  to fields in the IP and TCP headers and some constants
Updated the Makefiles to reference the linux-include directory which has
  these standard definitions of the network structures

Upgraded libpcap to version 0.3.1a3 which has a slightly different API
  but cleaned up the code to reflect the changes.  New version has all
  of the linux code aparently (included SLIP and PPP) but now has support
  for the HPUX packet capture interface

Cleaned up the Makefiles significantly

******* 4-23-97 kaminsky

Added a tcp=0 option.  All packets passed in from the BPF are considered.
  If the dest port is < 1024 we put it in the LTOH direction
  If the source port is < 1024 we put it in th HTOL direction
Possible addition would be to make it so that user server ports (> 5000)
  are also classified.  Some ports like 2105 for krlogin are not grabbed
  so one has to do tcp=2105 manually
For example, run ipse like:  ipse tcp=0 -- "port telnet"

******* 5-10-97 kaminsky

Made tcp with nothing after it the same as tcp=0
Added support for PPP
Added support for UDP packet forging
Added support for TCP packet forging

There are some modifications in libpcap/pcap.h and libpcap/pcap-linux.c
  which are flagged with /* added by kaminsky */.  Basically, I just added
  about 3 functions and their declarations

******* 5-14-97 kaminsky

for the solaris packet writing code; added functions and some includes at
  the top to pcap-dlpi.c
packet forging on solaris work; I can forge a UDP echo packet from x -> y 
  running ipse on espresso and see the echo go and come back
