As mobile computing continues on its rapid growth curve, mobile users
are discovering that connectivity to their desktop data, email, and the
Internet is at least as important as the computing resources of their
laptop or PDA.  However, there is at least an order-of-magnitude
mismatch between the communication requirements of today's multimedia
applications (e.g. the WWW and videoconferencing) and the performance
and cost of today's wireless networks.

We can isolate mobile devices of all kinds from poor networks, by
letting mobile applications communicate with a {\em proxy process}
running on a well-connected desktop workstation, such as most mobile
users already have access to at home or at work.  The proxy {\em
distills} the semantic content of some desired data, creating a compact
representation for transmission to the mobile device over the slow
connection. Computing by proxy trades inexpensive and often
underutilized compute cycles on the desktop
for expensive wireless network bandwidth.

Datatype-specific distillation produces compact yet semantically rich
representations in real time, eliminating the need for servers to
provide multiple representations explicitly, as they do in [1].  For
example, size and colordepth reduction on a still image produce a useful
"thumbnail" that is two orders of magnitude smaller than the original.
The user can then decide whether to expend the bandwidth to {\em refine}
the representation to one of higher quality.  The degree of distillation
is dynamically determined based on the latency, bandwidth and cost
predictions of a continuously-updated statistical model of network
performance [2].  This approach makes handoff across heterogenenous
networks [3] and transient network loading transparent to most
applications.

We are developing a multi-platform, high-level interface for development
of applications that exploit computation by proxy.  For an on-line
demonstration of distillation for WWW browsing, see
