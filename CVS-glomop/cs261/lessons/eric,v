@Our last lecture (or last two lectures, maybe!) should have been
more of a "summary" lecture than a "new material" lecture.  It would
be nice to wrap up with some cross-cutting issues and principles.
It can still have new stuff in it -- but new high-level principles
and anecdotes, not new low-level systems issues.
(This also helps get good HKN reviews. :-)
And this would be a good exercise anyway.
