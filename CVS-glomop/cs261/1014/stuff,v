@Ian did the following:
-- covered ENIDS ("walk up the protocol stack and show the insertion
   and evasion attacks at each level"; talk about defenses, e.g.
   canonicalization)
-- started on application-layer holes
   -- problems with CGI servers, e.g. the phf problem
      (it essentially calls system("ph $arg"))
   -- simple buffer overruns: just the case where you overwrite other
      crucial variables, not the stack smashing stuff.  e.g.:
         char path[512];
	 int isrunningasroot = 0;
	 ...
	 strcpy(path, getenv("HOME"));
	 strcat(path, "/.myprogrc");
	 f = fopen(path, "r");
	 ...
