@Our project write-up is online at:
http://www-cad.eecs.berkeley.edu/~mds/classes/cs261/writeup.html

While our implementation is not as grand as we originally wished,
it does work, and we would be happy to demo the proof-of-concept
to you in the 440 lab, if you are interested.

Thanks for a great class, it was really interesting!

Mark & Chen-Nee
