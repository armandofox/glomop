@You can fetch the paper from
<http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~nikitab/projects/auth-agent/paper-cs261.ps>.
I'd like to give it a final editing pass to correct for grammar and such
before I link it in to my web page; however, I will play by the rules
and not change the file at the above URL.  If you _happen_ to not read
my paper until Tuesday, I recommend that you look at the revised
version; it will just be called .../paper.ps.
