@Hi, David,

You can download our report from following web page 
http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~hoon/261/papers/seproxy-security-combined-5.doc
http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~hoon/261/papers/seproxy-security-combined-5.htm
The html version format is a bit crude though.
Also, I am trying to make the pdf and ps file out of word document and 
make it available to you before 9:00am tommorrow.
I just wanted to make it sure that the word document can be submitted as 
it is in the case the pdf or ps file is not good-looking to you.

I am going to put paper copy in your mail box also.

Thanks,
Talk to you later,

--hoon.


Hi, David,

You can download the ps file which is same version of doc file that I sent
to you yesterday from following web page.

We also put paper copy in your mail box.

Please let me know if you have problem in locating ps or doc file.
Thanks,
