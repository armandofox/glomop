    <H2>Introduction</H2>

    The real identity of a GSM MS and its subscriber is the data
    stored in the SIM (Subscriber Identity Module).&nbsp; SIM comes in
    two physical sizes: credit card Type (ISO) and smaller plug in
    SIM.&nbsp; The heart of SIM card is a microcontroller that
    includes ROM, and additional memory EEPROM (Electrical Erasable
    and Programmable Read Only Memory. Operating power supply and
    clock pulses are provided by ME (Mobile Equipment). It has its own
    OS. <p>

	There are four basic security services provided by GSM:
	<ul>
	  <li> Anonymity: TMSI(temporary mobile subscriber identification)
	  assignment. Use of temporary identifier for the MS user. A
	  user's IMSI has to be protected over the air interface, so GSM
	  temporarily assign a user an ID that is known as TMSI. (used for
	  roaming purposes, so that IMSI is not sent over the air).

	  <li> Authentication: Authentication procedure is performed after
	  the subscriber identity (IMSI) is known by the network and
	  before the channel is encrypted.

	  <li> Signaling data and voice protection against eavesdropping: encryption
		<ul>
		  <li>A3: Used for subscriber autehntication 
		  <li>A5: Used for ciphering/deciphering (stream cipher)
		  <li>A8: Used to generate K<sub>c</sub>
		</ul>
	  <li> User's SIM modeule and ME ID: assures that no
	  stolen/unauthorized ME is used in the system.

	</ul>

	<H2>Details </H2>

    
    <H4> Security Model </H4>
    
    <ul>
      <li>PIN Personal identification number: User has to enter a PIN
      code. MS compares this PIN with the PIN stored in the SIM, if
      two PINs agree, user is granted access to the MS.
      
      <li>Ki = internal key stored on SIM. RAND = 128 bit random value
      from network (AC = authentication center). Network sends (RAND,
      K<sub>c</sub>, SRES) to BS.  MS uses A3 to compute SRES(Signed
      Responses Authentication Result)and A8 used to generate
      K<sub>c</sub> (ciphering key). SRES is 32 bit and K<sub>c</sub>
      is 64 bit. MS sends SRES to the BS and BS checks it againts SRES
      from network. If they agree, access is granted.  MS and BS uses
      <sub>c</sub> to encrypt/decrypte data through the air.

	  <li>GSM A5 is a Stream cipher, the keystream is the xor of three
	  clock controlled registers. There is a trivial 2^40 attack
	  (guess the contents of registers 1 and 2, work out register 3
	  from the keystream, and then step on to check whether the guess
	  was right). 2^40 trial encryptions could take weeks on a
	  workstation, but the low gate count of the algorithm means that
	  a Xilinx chip can easily be programmed to do keysearch, and an
	  A5 cracker might have a few dozen of these running at maybe 2
	  keys per microsecond each.
      
      <li>Card holder verification 1 (CHV1) = PIN1, requested when the
      mobile phone is turned on. If it's incorrect after 3 times, you
      need to enter 8 digit Personal unblocking key (PUK) which is
      sotred on SIm and operators know.  If 10 time incorrect, SIM
      card completely blocked. Need to take it back to operator.
      
      <li>Card holder verification 2 (CHV2) = PIN2, required to be
      entered for access to specific procedures, e.g. change some
      types of information. If blocked, lost some functions.
    </ul>

    <H4>SIM Memory</H4>
    
    <ul>
      <li>Main directory Master file (MF)
      
		<ul>
      <li>Dedicated files (DF)
			<ul>
			  <li>DFgsm contains specific applications for GSM, DCS1800 or PCS 1900
			  <li>DF telecom contains more common telecom service features
				<ul>
				  <li>Elementary files (EF), one EF can contain only
				  one record, e.g. IMSI (International Mobile
				  Subscriber identity). Record sizes measured in words
				  (1 word = 1 byte).
      
				  <li>PHone book belongs to DF telecom
				</ul>
			</ul>
		</ul>
    
	  <li>IMSI: first 3 digits = MCC (mobile country code), next 2
	  digits = MNC (mobile network code), up to 10 additional digits:
	  MSIN (mobile subscriber identification number)

	  <li>Storage capacities (page 163 of GSM system engineering by ASha Mehrotra)

	</ul>
    
	<H4>Call Set Up</H4>
	<ul>
	  <li>MS sends call set up message to MSC. After checking access
	  right, MSC assigneds TCH, and sends Call proceeding message to
	  MS. MSC sends TAM to PSTN/ISDN switching center, which is
	  responsible for preperly routing the call.
