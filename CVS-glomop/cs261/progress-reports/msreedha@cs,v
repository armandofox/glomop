Subject: CS261 Project status Report : Multicast Security

We have done an extensive survey of all existing literature on multicast
security and understand the issues involved.  We have designed a multicast
key distribution protocol that scales and can tolerates losses and faults.
Our protocol has the same basic idea as proposed in some recent papers,
with slight extensions to handle bursty joins/leaves. We also do not
assume a reliable multicast protocol to distribute keys. Our focus is
mainly on multimedia applications for which disruption of the media stream
due to rekeying operations is undesirable and should be minimized.
(At this point, we are not concentrating on authentication of the real
time stream)

We are currently writing a simulation to study the performance of the
protocol and to determine the proper input parameters. Then we plan to
incorporate the protocol into the MASH toolkit tools to obtain
actual measurements (We have studied the MASH toolkit and have identified
where we need to plug in our changes)

We would like to briefly discuss our protocol and get some feedback from
you next week. 

Thanks,
Sreedhar Mukkamalla
