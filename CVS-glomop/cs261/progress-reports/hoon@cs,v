PROJECT OVERVIEW 

As a quick reminder (and to make the terminology more clear), our
project is to create client and server applications to allow secure
email for the palm pilot.  We are implementing this by creating a
proxy server to fetch mail from a standard IMAP or POP3 server,
perform any cryptographic operations on it (decryption and/or
verifying signatures), and send it to the palm pilot client.  We will
also be creating a secure cache to store the resulting decrypted
messages for future retrieval by the client.


PROMISED PROGRESS

By this point, we had originally hoped to be finished with the basic
aspects of the proxy implementation (fetching from the IMAP/POP
server, handling the protocol, etc.)  Additionally, we had hoped to
be about half way through our work on basic aspects of the palm pilot
client implementation.  


ACTUAL PROGRESS

Our basic proxy functionality is mostly complete.  We have not
started the coding for the PDA at this time, but we have been looking
at code examples to familiarize ourselves with the platform.
Additionally, although we had originally planned on implementing POP
and/or IMAP as the communication protocol between the PDA and our
proxy, we have decided instead to implement our own simpler protocol
as this both gives us more flexibility in implementation and allows us
to avoid implementing some of the more esoteric features of POP and
(especially) IMAP.


EXPLICIT GOALS FOR FINALIZING THE PROJECT

11/13   proxy implementation complete

        This will include finishing the protocol handling for
        communication between the proxy and the IMAP/P0P servers as
        well as the communication between the proxy and the client.
        Additionally, we will have completed the functionality for the
        secure cache.  One issue we are struggling with to a certain
        degree is how to best handle the communication between the
        proxy and the IMAP/POP server.  We are currently using the
        built-in Java mail packages, although we are having some
	difficulties with the interface.  We completed the store object
	implementation for pop3 and finishing up with imap store object.
	If these difficulties cannot be resolved,
        we will instead do a direct implementation of the subsets of
        IMAP and POP that we require. 

11/27   basic PDA client software complete

        This involves modifying the existing source code for the Pilot
        mail client to allow create network connections to directly
        download mail from the proxy server.  There are good examples
        of networking code for the Pilot, so we do not anticipate any
        tremendous snags with this.  Additionally, we will need to
        modify some of the internal data structures used by the mail
        program, to keep track of things such as the key used to cache
        a particular message.  

12/04   optimizations 

        There are several optimizations we are considering to improve
        the communication performance on the (potentially
        low-bandwidth) link between the PDA and the proxy.  Among
        other things, we may have our proxy cache not only the
        individual messages, but also the most recent list of message
        headers that the client has seen.  This will allow the proxy
        to communicate only the newly added or removed messages to the
        client which will reduce communication time.  Additionally, if
        time permits we may expand the communication protocol between
        the client and our proxy to encompass some of the more
        sophisticated behavior of IMAP, such as partial message
        retrieval or message folders.

12/11   project write up

        The project write up will be on-going through the latter
        stages of our work.  We plan to complete this no later than
        12/11.
