Hi,

I had checked out the three volumes of internetworking with TCP/IP by
Comer and looked over the sections about BSD socket programming. Also, I
went over the pcap code and the packet-sending code written by your
undergrad student. I think I would use your student's code because it is
on a high level and I don't have to deal with as much detail. 

As you guys had already done for me, for testing purpose, a machine is
running a sniffer. And you gave me root access to seesaw. The resources
are in place for me to do some programming.
