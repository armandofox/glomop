"Traffic Analysis of SSL-Encrypted Web Browsing"
------------------------------------------------
	
	Our research indicates that simple traffic analysis techniques can 
identify the web pages browsed using SSL encryption with a high degree of 
accuracy. Preliminary results also suggest that simple defenses may be 
effective in evading traffic analysis under some circumstances.

	We used tcpdump to examine the HTTP network traffic associated with
web browsing. While certain technical complications remain, we have been able
to determine from tcpdump data the size of a given HTML file in bytes, as well
as the total size of all image objects embedded in a webpage. The dump also
appears to contain clues concerning the number of embedded objects and their
sizes. We developed a program which analyzes a locally archived website and
produces a catalog which includes the sizes of each file, the object structure
of each webpage, and the link structure of the website. This information can
then be used to predict the identity of a page based on information extracted
from the tcpdump data.

	We experimented with two testbeds, the ISAAC website and the Digital
Libraries website (elib.cs.berkeley.edu), a more extensive and diverse site
containing roughly 2500 files and 700 webpages. We tested our traffic
analysis system using a simulation which randomly selects webpages from a
testbed. In this simulation we were able to correctly identify webpages 80-97% 
of the time. Our data also suggests that random length padding is quite
effective: an average of 100-200 bytes of padding reduces accuracy to about 50%.
In the near future, we plan to integrate the network traffic analysis and
website analysis components in order to test our traffic analysis attack under 
more realistic web browsing conditions. We will also experiment with extending
our traffic analysis techniques to consider sequences of pages.
