CS261 Homework 1 (Helen J. Wang)

Question 1:
~~~~~~~~~~~
1. ftpd/gnutar interaction

 	Following the principle of "keep it simple", disallow 
	"ftp" using gnutar.  It is safer for exposed machine
	to run smaller code.

2. imperfect bookkeeping in sendmail leading to holes in alias expansion
	and program execution

	By applying the "fail safe default" principle, if no checking
	is performed, then fail to execute. 
	
3. complete mediation in Java
	Java security model is not "psycologically acceptable" since 
	developers have to do the checking themselves.  
	By applying principle of "fail-safe defaults", namely, disallow
	all operations unless it is checked with the security manager.
	In another word, all operations are invoked from or within the 
	security manager.

4. tractorbeaming wu-ftpd
	By following the "least priviledge" principle, give signal
	handlers' only the priviledge they need, as minimal as possible.


Question 2
~~~~~~~~~~
The Java applet can 
	- send an email to a user at the host where Java applet came 
	- let Java applet display something for indication of the 
		occurrence of some events or activities which may
		be confidential

Question 3
~~~~~~~~~~
1. TCP hijacking, by predicting sequence number, and send packets with
	that sequence number ahead of the real packet, and within the
	packet, insert "echo ++ > ~/.rhosts".  

2. ECB has weakness that if the inputs are the same, so are the output.
	replay attack can leverage this fact.  And the secret key can
	also be cracked leveraging this fact.  Then do the same as in 
	1.

3. Physically stealing the secret key can help here.  Or sniffing 
	during the key exchange, and obtain the key from other 
	convert channels, like tapping the phone line when Alice
	and Bob exchanging the secret key over the phone.

4. The right way to fix this is to have a secure key management through
	public key crypto.  Then use good secret key crypto for data
	encryption.  And secret keys should be changed per session or
	transaction to prevent replay attacks.


Question 4
~~~~~~~~~~
1. The weakness is that "denial of service" can be achieved by anyone
	sending the plaintext error message with its predicted DNS id, 
	so the actual message is treated as a dup.

2. Caching can be performed at different levels of DNS tree, with different
	timeout values.  The closer to the root, the longer the timeout
	since those DNS records less likely changes.  Upon timeout, 
	cached DNS record will be invalidated.
