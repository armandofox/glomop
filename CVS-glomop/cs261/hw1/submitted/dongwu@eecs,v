CS 261 HW#1

1.1 Whenever a process is starting up, do a permission check, whether or
not
it is a child process of a trusted process.  The principle of complete
mediation is used.

1.2 Disable the feature of treating program execution as an address. 
Restructure the sendmail program. For alias usage, just do search on an
alias
database to get the addresses. I think this feature is rather
complicated; the 
principle of economy of mechanism is used.

1.3 Let the OS do the security check, and thus relieve the developer
from doing
so. The principle of complete mediation is used.

1.4 Create a locking mechanism. Lock the code segment where the
privilege 
level is elevated, then there is no way for the user to send commands
when
the code segment is executed.


2. (a) The applet might have access to the cache if it processes a lot
	of data.
   (b) The applet connects to X11 and thus can monitor keystrokes, dump
   	data from screen, etc.
   (c) The applet might also get other information from the xhost
trusted 
	list of machines.


3.1 If no cryptography is used, then you can monitor the data in the
network,
and thus record the login information.

3.2 & 3.3 If the data is encryted, you can intercept the packets from
the 
server and client, and send your own packets to them.

3.4 To fix these, a digital sigiture mechanism should be a good
solution. 
When a machine receives a packet, it should be able to verify its
source.

4.1 Since there is no authentication for negative responses, a denial
of service attack can be staged. You can send a negative response to
kill
a connection when the host actually exists.

4.2 The most specific machine found should send the negative response. 
For 
example, if www.berkeley.edu is not found, but berkeley.edu is found,
then
berkeley.edu should sign and send the negative response. Since
performance is
of concern, the negative responses should have priority for processing,
so 
that resource can be freed up as soon as possible. That is, as soon as a
negative response is received, it should be put to the cache for
immediate
processing.
