\chapter*{Abstract}
Security is a serious concern on today's computer networks.
Many applications are not very good at resisting attack,
and our operating systems are not very good at preventing
the spread of any intrusions that may result.
In this thesis, we propose to manage the risk of a security breach by
confining these untrusted (and untrustworthy) applications in a
carefully sanitized space.
We design a secure environment for confinement of untrusted applications
by restricting the program's access to the operating system.
In our prototype implementation, we intercept and filter dangerous system calls
via the Solaris process tracing facility.
This enables us to build a simple, clean, user-mode
mechanism for confining untrusted applications.
Our implementation has negligible performance impact,
and can protect pre-existing legacy code.

\chapter*{Acknowledgements}
% \chapter*{Attributions and Acknowledgements}
Some of these results have been published previously as joint
work with Ian Goldberg, Randi Thomas, and Eric Brewer
in \cite{janus-usenix}.
Some of the text from that paper (as well as some text from the unpublished
manuscript \cite{ortho}, jointly written with Ian Goldberg and Eric Brewer)
has been adapted for use herein.

We gratefully acknowledge the efforts of Michael Kaminski,
who helped code up the necessary extensions to
apply Janus to {\tt sendmail}.

Thanks also to Steven Bellovin, David Oppenheimer,
Armando Fox, Steve Gribble, Alex Aiken, and various anonymous reviewers
for their helpful comments.
Thanks especially to Alex Aiken for a number of insightful observations
about the design of Janus.

Finally and most importantly, I am deeply indebted to Eric Brewer
for his direction and advice.  His comments, both high-level and
low-level, have greatly improved this thesis.  Thank you, Eric.
