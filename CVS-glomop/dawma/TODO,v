+ Eric says (p.46): ``need better summary of ptrace++ faults \\
  for OS designers \\ what would you add to OS requirements list?''
+ Mention as OS design criterion to consider allowing interposition
  on all security-related events.  Currently "security-related
  event = system call", but it's not clear that this is a perfect
  match.  In general, whereever the kernel does one or two access
  control checks, make room to add a third.  (Cite SMB / BIS paper.)
