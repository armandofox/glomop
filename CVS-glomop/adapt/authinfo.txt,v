AUTHOR BIOS:

Armando Fox received a BSEE from M.I.T. and an MSEE from the University
of Illinois, has worked as a CPU architect at Intel Corp., and is
currently completing his Ph.D. at the University of California,
Berkeley, as a researcher in the Daedalus/BARWAN and InfoPad projects.
He will be an assistant professor at Stanford University starting in
January 1999.  His primary interests are application-level support for
adaptive mobile computing, multimedia networks for mobile computing, and
user interface issues related to mobile computing.  He can be reached at
fox@@alum.mit.edu.

Steven Gribble received a combined Computer Science and Physics Bachelor
of Science degree from the University of British Columbia (Vancouver,
Canada) in 1995, and a Computer Science Master of Science degree from
the University of California, Berkeley in 1997.  He is currently
pursuing his Ph.D. at Berkeley, and expects to graduate in May of 2000.
His interests include application-level support for adaptive mobile
computing, and system and compiler support for scalable,
highly-available infrastructure services.  He can be reached
at gribble@@cs.berkeley.edu. 


Yatin Chawathe is a doctoral student at the University of California,
Berkeley. He received a Bachelor of Engineering (Computer Engineering)
degree from the University of Bombay, India, and a Master of Science
(Computer Science) from the University of California, Berkeley. His
primary interests are internet services, application support for
reliable multicast in heterogeneous environments, and multimedia 
networking. He can be reached at yatin@@cs.berkeley.edu. 

Eric A. Brewer is an Assistant Professor of Computer Science at
U.C. Berkeley, and received his Ph.D. in Computer Science from MIT in
1994.  His research interests include mobile and wireless computing (the
InfoPad and Daedalus projects), scalable servers (the NOW, Inktomi, and
TACC projects), and application- and system-level security (the ISAAC
project).  Prof. Brewer's previous work includes multiprocessor-network
software and topologies, and high-performance multiprocessor simulation.
