<H2>A Brief Timeline of Cryptography</H2>

<UL>

<p><li> about 1900 BC; civ; Kahn p.71;

an Egyptian scribe used non-standard hieroglyphs in an inscription.  Kahn
lists this as the first documented example of written cryptography.

<p><li> 487 BC; govt; Kahn p.82;

the Greeks used a device called the ``skytale'' -- a staff around which a
long, thin strip of leather was wrapped and written on.  The leather was
taken off and worn as a belt.  Presumably, the recipient would have a
matching staff and the encrypting staff would be left home.

<p><li> 50-60 BC; govt; Kahn p.83;

<B>Julius Caesar</B> (100-44 BC) used a simple substitution with the normal
alphabet (just shifting the letters a fixed amount) in government
communciations.  This cipher was less strong than ATBASH, by a small
amount, but in a day when few people read in the first place, it was good
enough.  He also used tansliteration of Latin into Greek letters and a number
of other simple ciphers.

<P><LI> 725-790?; govt/(civ); Kahn p.97;

<B>Abu `Abd al-Rahman al-Khalil ibn Ahmad ibn `Amr ibn Tammam al Farahidi
al-Zadi al Yahmadi</b> wrote a (now lost) book on cryptography, inspired
by his solution of a cryptogram in Greek for the Byzantine emperor.  His
solution was based on known (correctly guessed) plaintext at the message
start -- a standard cryptanalytic method, used even in WW-II against
Enigma messages.

     <p><li> 1412; civ; Kahn p.95-6;

<b>Shihab al-Din abu `l-`Abbas Ahmad ben `Ali ben Ahmad `Abd Allah
al-Qalqashandi</b> wrote &quot;Subh al-a `sha&quot;, a 14-volume Arabic
encyclopedia which included a section on cryptology.  This information was
attributed to <b>Taj ad-Din `Ali ibn ad-Duraihim ben Muhammad ath-Tha`alibi
al-Mausili</b> who lived from 1312 to 1361 but whose writings on cryptology
have been lost. The list of ciphers in this work included both substitution
and transposition and, for the first time, a cipher with multiple
substitutions for each plaintext letter.  Also traced to Ibn al-Duraihim is
an exposition on and worked example of cryptanalysis, including the use of
tables of letter frequencies and sets of letters which can not occur
together in one word.

<p><li> 1790's; civ/govt; Kahn p.192, Cryptologia v.5 No.4 pp.193-208;

<b>Thomas Jefferson</b>, possibly aided by <b>Dr. Robert Patterson</b> (a
mathematician at U. Penn.), invented his wheel cipher.  This was
re-invented in several forms later and used in WW-II by the US Navy as the
Strip Cipher, M-138-A.

<B>Charles Babbage</b> seems to have re-invented the wheel cipher.

<P><li> 1917; gov;

     <B>Ambassador Bernstorff</B> of the German government sent the
     following encrypted &quot;Zimmerman Telegram&quot; message to the
     German minister &quot;von Eckhardt&quot; in Mexico city:

     <P>

     <a href="gifs/zimmerman.jpg">encrypted</a>

     <a href="gifs/plaintext.html">plaintext</a>
     
<p><li> 1919; civ; Kahn p.422;

<B>Arvid Gerhard Damm</b> applied for a patent in Sweden for a mechanical
rotor cipher machine.  This machine grew into a family of cipher machines
under the direction of <B>Boris Caesar Wilhelm Hagelin</b> who took over
the business and was the only one of the commercial cryptographers of this
period to make a thriving business.  After the war, a Swedish law which
enabled the government to appropriate inventions it felt important to
defense caused Hagelin to move the company to Zug Switzerland where it was
incorporated as Crypto AG.  The company is still in operation, although
facing controversy for having allegedly weakened a cipher product for sale
to Iran.

<p><li> 1927-33; civ; Kahn p.802ff;

users of cryptography weren't limited to legitimate bankers, lovers,
experimenters, etc.  There were also a handful of criminals.  ``The
greatest era of international smuggling -- Prohibition -- created the
greatest era of criminal cryptology.'' <i>[p.817]</i> To this day, the FBI
runs a cryptanalytic office to deal with criminal cryptography.  [As of
Kahn's writing in 1967, that office was located at 215 Pennsylvania Avenue
SE, Washington DC.]

     <blockquote>

``A retired lieutenant commander of the Royal Navy devised the systems for
Consolidated Exporters' Pacific operation, though its Gulf and Atlantic
groups made up their own as needed.

<P>

``His name was unknown but his cryptologic expertise was apparent.  The
smugglers' systems grew increasingly more complicated. &quot;Some of these
are of a complexity never even attempted by any government for its most
secret communications,&quot; wrote <B>Mrs. [Elizebeth Smith] Friedman</b>
in a report in mid-1930.  &quot;At no time during the World War, when
secret methods of communication reached their highest development, were
there used such involved ramifications as are to be found in some of the
correspondence of West Coast rum running vessels.&quot; '' <i>[p.804]</i>

</blockquote>

<p><li> 1933-45; govt; Kahn p.422 (and many others);

The Enigma machine was not a commercial success but it was taken over and
improved upon to become the cryptographic workhorse of Nazi Germany.  [It
was broken by the Polish mathematician, <B>Marian Rejewski</b>, based only
on captured ciphertext and one list of three months worth of daily keys
obtained through a spy.  Continued breaks were based on developments during
the war by <b>Alan Turing, Gordon Welchman</b> and others at Bletchley Park
in England.]

     <p>
     
     <a href="gifs/rotor.jpg">enigma</a>

<p><li> 1976; civ/govt; FIPS PUB-46;

a design by IBM, based on the Lucifer cipher and with changes (including
both S-box improvements and reduction of key size) by the US NSA, was
chosen to be the U.S. Data Encryption Standard.  It has since found
worldwide acceptance, largely because it has shown itself strong against 20
years of attacks.  Even some who believe it is past its useful life use it
as a component -- e.g., of 3-key triple-DES.

<p><li> 1976; civ; Diffie;

<B>Whitfield Diffie</b> and <b>Martin Hellman</b> published ``New
Directions in Cryptography'', introducing the idea of public key
cryptography.  They also put forth the idea of authentication by powers of
a one way function, now used in the S/Key challenge/response utility.  They
closed their paper with an observation for which this timeline web page
gives detailed evidence: ``Skill in production cryptanalysis has always
been heavily on the side of the professionals, but innovation, particularly
in the design of new types of cryptographic systems, has come primarily
from amateurs.''

<p><li> April 1977; civ; Shamir;

Inspired by the Diffie-Hellman paper and acting as complete novices in
cryptography, <B>Ronald L. Rivest, Adi Shamir</b> and <B>Leonard M.
Adleman</b> had been discussing how to make a practical public key system.
One night in April, Ron Rivest was laid up with a massive headache and the
RSA algorithm came to him.  He wrote it up for Shamir and Adleman and sent
it to them the next morning.  It was a practical public-key cipher for both
confidentiality and digital signatures, based on the difficulty of
factoring large numbers.  They submitted this to Martin Gardner on April 4
for publication in Scientific American.  It appeared in the September, 1977
issue.  The Scientific American article included an offer to send the full
technical report to anyone submitting a self-addressed, stamped envelope.
There were thousands of such requests, from all over the world.

<P>

Someone at NSA objected to the distribution of this report to foreign
nationals and for a while, RS&amp;A suspended mailings -- but when NSA
failed to respond to inquiries asking for the legal basis of their request,
RS&amp;A resumed mailings.  Adi Shamir believes this is the origin of the
current policy [as of August 1995] that technical reports or papers can be
freely distributed.  [Note: two international journals, ``Cryptologia'' and
``The Journal of Cryptology'' were founded shortly after this attempt by
NSA to restrain publication.]

<P>

Contrary to rumor, RS&amp;A apparently had no knowledge of ITAR or patent
secrecy orders.  They did not publish before applying for international
patents because they wanted to avoid such restraints on free expression but
rather because they were not thinking about patents for the algorithm.
They just wanted to get the idea out.

<p><li> 1990; civ; IACR90;

<B>Charles H. Bennett, Gilles Brassard</b> et al. published their
experimental results on Quantum Cryptography, which uses single photons to
communicate a stream of key bits for some later Vernam encipherment of a
message (or other uses).  Assuming the laws of quantum mechanics hold,
Quantum Cryptography provides not only secrecy but a positive indication of
eavesdropping and a measurement of the maximum number of bits an
eavesdropper might have captured.  On the downside, QC currently requires a
fiber-optic cable between the two parties.

<p><li> 1991; civ; Garfinkel;

<b>Phil Zimmerman</b> released his first version of PGP (Pretty Good
Privacy) in response to the threat by the FBI to demand access to the
cleartext of the communications of citizens.  Although PGP offered little
beyond what was already available in products like Mailsafe from RSADSI,
PGP is notable because it was released as freeware and has become a
worldwide standard as a result.

  Here Legrand, having re-heated the parchment, submitted It my
inspection. The following characters were rudely traced, in a red
tint, between the death's-head and the goat:

   53++!305))6*;4826)4+.)4+);806*;48!8`60))85;]8*:+*8!83(88)5*!;

   4;48)4+;161;:188;+?;

  "In the present case --indeed in all cases of secret writing --the
first question regards the language of the cipher; for the
principles of solution, so far, especially, as the more simple ciphers
are concerned, depend on, and are varied by, the genius of the
particular idiom. In general, there is no alternative but experiment
(directed by probabilities) of every tongue known to him who
attempts the solution, until the true one be attained.
  "You observe there are no divisions between the words. Had there
been divisions, the task would have been comparatively easy. In such
case I should have commenced with a collation and analysis of the
shorter words, and, had a word of a single letter occurred, as is most
likely, (a or I, for example,) I should have considered the solution
as assured. But, there being no division, my first step was to
ascertain the predominant letters, as well as the least frequent.
Counting all, I constructed a table, thus:

  Of the character 8 there are 33.
                   ;     "     26.
                   4     "     19.
                 + )     "     16.
                   *     "     13.
                   5     "     12.
                   6     "     11.
                 ! 1     "      8.
                   0     "      6.
                 9 2     "      5.
                 : 3     "      4.
                   ?     "      3.
                   `     "      2.
                 - .     "      1.

"Now, in English, the letter which most frequently occurs is e.
Afterwards, the succession runs thus: a o i d h n r s t u y c f g l
m w b k p q x z. E however predominates so remarkably that an
individual sentence of any length is rarely seen, in which it is not
the prevailing character.
  "Here, then, we have, in the very beginning, the groundwork for
something more than a mere guess. The general use which may be made of
the table is obvious --but, in this particular cipher, we shall only
very partially require its aid. As our predominant character is 8,
we will commence by assuming it as the e of the natural alphabet. To
verify the supposition, let us observe if the 8 be seen often in
couples --for e is doubled with great frequency in English --in such
words, for example, as 'meet,' 'fleet,' 'speed, 'seen,' 'been,'
'agree,' etc. In the present instance we see it doubled less than
five times, although the cryptograph is brief.
  "Let us assume 8, then, as e. Now, of all words in the language,
'the' is the most usual; let us see, therefore, whether they are not
repetitions of any three characters in the same order of
collocation, the last of them being 8. If we discover repetitions of
such letters, so arranged, they will most probably represent the
word 'the.' On inspection, we find no less than seven such
arrangements, the characters being ;48. We may, therefore, assume that
the semicolon represents t, that 4 represents h, and that 8 represents
e --the last being now well confirmed. Thus a great step has been
taken.
  "But, having established a single word, we are enabled to
establish a vastly important point; that is to say, several
commencements and terminations of other words. Let us refer, for
example, to the last instance but one, in which the combination ;48
occurs --not far from the end of the cipher. We know that the
semicolon immediately ensuing is the commencement of a word, and, of
the six characters succeeding this 'the,' we are cognizant of no
less than five. Let us set these characters down, thus, by the letters
we know them to represent, leaving a space for the unknown--

                             t eeth.

  "Here we are enabled, at once, to discard the 'th,' as forming no
portion of the word commencing with the first t; since, by
experiment of the entire alphabet for a letter adapted to the
vacancy we perceive that no word can be formed of which this th can be
a part. We are thus narrowed into

                               t ee,

and, going through the alphabet, if necessary, as before, we arrive at
the word 'tree,' as the sole possible reading. We thus gain another
letter, r, represented by (, with the words 'the tree' in
juxtaposition.
  "Looking beyond these words, for a short distance, we again see
the combination ;48, and employ it by way of termination to what
immediately precedes. We have thus this arrangement:

                          the tree ;4(+?34 the,

or substituting the natural letters, where known, it reads thus:

                           the tree thr+?3h the.

  "Now, if, in place of the unknown characters, we leave blank spaces,
or substitute dots, we read thus:

                           the tree thr...h the,

when the word 'through' makes itself evident at once. But this
discovery gives us three new letters, o, u and g, represented by + ?
and 3.
  "Looking now, narrowly, through the cipher for combinations of known
characters, we find, not very far from the beginning, this
arrangement,

                           83(88, or egree,

which, plainly, is the conclusion of the word 'degree,' and gives us
another letter, d, represented by !.
  "Four letters beyond the word 'degree,' we perceive the combination

                          ;46(;88*.

  "Translating the known characters, and representing the unknown by
dots, as before, we read thus:

                           th.rtee.

an arrangement immediately suggestive of the word 'thirteen,' and
again furnishing us with two new characters, i and n, represented by 6
and *.
  "Referring, now, to the beginning of the cryptograph, we find the
combination,

                            53++!.

  "Translating, as before, we obtain

                            .good,

which assures us that the first letter is A, and that the first two
words are 'A good.'
  "To avoid confusion, it is now time that we arrange our key, as
far as discovered, in a tabular form. It will stand thus:


                   5 represents a
                   !    "       d
                   8    "       e
                   3    "       g
                   4    "       h
                   6    "       i
                   *    "       n
                   +    "       o
                   (    "       r
                   ;    "       t

"We have, therefore, no less than ten of the most important letters
represented, and it will be unnecessary to proceed with the details of
the solution. I have said enough to convince you that ciphers of
this nature are readily soluble, and to give you some insight into the
rationale of their development. But be assured that the specimen
before us appertains to the very simplest species of cryptograph. It
now only remains to give you the full translation of the characters
upon the parchment, as unriddled. Here it is:
  'A good glass in the bishop's hostel in the devil's seat
twenty-one degrees and thirteen minutes northeast and by north main
branch seventh limb east side shoot from the left eye of the
death's-head a bee line from the tree through the shot fifty feet
out.'"

	  <BLOCKQUOTE>
	  <B>False Identity</b>. University email users shall not employ a
	  false identity. Email may, however, be sent
	  anonymously provided this does not violate any law or this or any
	  other University policy, and does not
	  unreasonably interfere with the administrative business of the
	  University.

	  <P>

	  The University shall only permit the inspection, monitoring, or
	  disclosure
	  of electronic mail without the consent of the holder of such email
	  when: (i) required by and consistent with law, (ii)
	  there is substantiated reason (as defined in Appendix A, Definitions)
	  to believe that violations of law or University
	  policy have taken place, or (iii) in exceptional cases, to meet
	  time-dependent, critical operational needs.

	  <B>substantiated reason:</b> Reliable evidence indicating that
	  violation of law or policy probably has occurred, as
	  distinguished from rumor, gossip, or other unreliable evidence.

     <li> Privacy - ability of an individual to protect information about
	  himself.  Anonymity - privacy of identity.  Persistent
	  vs. one-time anonymity.  Forward secrecy - inability of adversary
	  to recover security-critical information after the fact - don't
	  keep logs!

     <li> Message oriented vs. online services and privacy.

     <li> E-mail as a first step towards privacy

	       <li> public-key crypto
		    <ul>
			 <li> PGP and Phil Zimmerman - web of trust
			 <li> X.509 certificates - certification authorities

	       <li> type-0 remailer
		    <ul>
			 <li> anon.penet.fi - people assigned pseudonym,
			      messages stripped of identities.  Secret
			      identity table!  Traffic analysis!  <a
			      href="http://www.cybercom.net/~rnewman/scientology/anon/penet.html">Church of Scientology vs. anon.penet.fi</a>
		    </ul>

	       <li> type-1 remailer
		    <ul>
			 <li> remail@@c2.org - no pseudonyms, so no secret
			      identity table.  Mail logs completely
			      avoided.  Accept encrypted mail, decrypt it,
			      and remail it on - no traffic analysis.
			      Chaining through multiple remailers -
			      diversity assures tha one honest remailer is
			      all we need.  Randomly reorder messages to
			      prevent correlations.
		    </ul>

	       <li> type-2 remailer
		    <ul>
			 <li> http://www.obscura.com/~loki has information
			      about these.  Constant-length messages to
			      prevent correlation attacks.  Always uses
			      chaining and encryption.  Defenses against
			      replay attacaks.  Random cover traffic to
			      hide messages in the noise.
