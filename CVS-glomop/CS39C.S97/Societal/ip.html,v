<h2><center>Intellectual Property <BR>
CS39C Spring 1997</center></h2>

<hr>

This lecture material was gleaned from many sources on the net, most
notably papers by Pamela Samuelson and John Perry Barlow, but also numerous
other unnamed sources.  Thanks, world-wide-web!
<P>

<h2>What is intellectual property, anyway?</h2>
<ul>
     <li> &quot;property&quot; refers to ownership rights to tangible
	  things - owning a bicycle, owning real estate, etc.  property
	  rights define the extent of the object owned and hence the extent
	  of legal protection granted to the owner.
     <li> &quot;intellectual property&quot refers to ownership rights to
	  intangible things - the products of minds or intellect.  Works
	  of art, aeronautical designs, manufacturing processes,
	  implementations of computer algorithms or architectures for
	  performing some task.
     <li> overreaching goal of IP is to encourage intellectual development
	  by granting creator limited exclusive rights in return for the
	  public disclosure of inventions - which encourages scientific and
	  technological advancement.
</ul>

<h3>Patent legalities</h3>

<ul>
     <li> Patent is grant formalized by official document issued by US
	  govt - has the attributes of personal property.
	  <ul>
	       <li> owner of patent has right to exclude others from
		    making, using or selling the patentend invention;
		    enforcable against those who reverse engineer or
		    independently develop the invention
	       <li> prerequisites to obtaining a patent
		    <ul>
			 <li> novelty - must not have been invented before
			      - prior art must not exist (body of knowledge
			      or technical information, including printed
			      publications).  Must not be in public
			      domain, previously patented.
			 <li> utility - must be able to show that invention
			      does something useful, tangible, or real.
			      Anti-gravity machines or time travel
			      machines?
			 <li> non-obviousness - if subject matter sought to
			      be patented would be obvious to a person
			      having ordinary skill in the field of
			      invention at the time the invention was made.
			 <li> proper disclosure of invention - inventor
			      must sufficiently disclose to enable those
			      skilled in the field to make and use it.
			      Pending patents are held in confidence.
		    </ul>
	  </ul>
     <li> protection is granted for 17 years.  We've already seen an example of
	  where this lead to trouble for an inventor - Philo T. Farnsworth
	  vs. RCA (won, didn't grant licence, lost fortune), also didn't
	  protect him from international competition, and Edwin Armstrong,
	  who lost radio fortune in patent battles against RCA.
	  <ul>
	       <li> why 17 years?  Outdated - based on slower pace of
		    technology.
	       <li> what should length of patent protection be nowadays?
	  </ul>
     <li> Two types of patents:
	  <ul>
	       <li> utility patents - granted for processes, machines,
		    articles of manufacture, compositions of matter, and
		    improvements thereof
	       <li> design patents - granted to cover the appearance of an
		    article of manufacture
	  </ul>
     <li> enforcement is up to the holder of a patent - if granted, gain
	  injunction barring infringer's right to manufacture, use, or sell
	  during lawsuit, and if successful, compensation for lost
	  royalties due to infringement, plus interest.  Does not
	  compensate lawyer's fees...except in extreme circumstances.
     <li> In the software/computer industry, what is patentable?
	  <ul>
	       <li> patentable (statutory):
		    <ul>
			 <li> a machine - a computer or other programmable
			      apparatus whose actions are controlled by a
			      computer program or other form of software
			 <li> an article of manufacture - computer readable
			      memory that can be used to direct a computer
			      to function in a particular manner when used
			      by the computer
			 <li> a process - a series of operational steps to
			      be performed on or with the aid of a computer
		    </ul>
	       <li> not patentable (non-statutory) as indistinguishable
		    from abstract ideas, laws of nature, and natural
		    phenomena:
		    <ul>
			 <LI>&quot;a compilation of arrangement of data,
			      independent of any physical element&quot;
			      [such as a computer-readable memory];
			      
			 <LI>&quot;a known machine-readable storage medium
			      that is encoded with data representing
			      creative or artistic expression (e.g., a work
			      of music, art or literature). . . The
			      specific words or symbols that constitute a
			      computer program represent the expression of
			      the computer program and as such are a
			      literary creation.&quot; [Thus, it is not
			      permissible to incorporate program source
			      code in a claim.]
			      
			 <LI>&quot;a 'data structure' independent of any
			      physical element (i.e., not as implemented on
			      a physical component of a computer such as a
			      computer-readable memory to render that
			      component capable of causing a computer to
			      operate in a particular manner&quot;
			      
			 <LI>&quot;a process that does nothing more than
			      manipulate abstract ideas or concepts (e.g.,
			      a process consisting solely of the steps one
			      would follow in solving a mathematical
			      problem.&quot;  [e.g., a claim to a process
			      for converting one set of numbers to another
			      without recitation of any
			      computer-implemented steps.]
	  </ul>
     <li> Advantages
	  <ul>
	       <li> protection is broad, patent protects against
		    independent development
	       <li> prohibit another person or company from patenting same
		    invention
	       <li> like the swiss army, much of the value of patents is
		    that they act as a deterrent.
	  </ul>
     <li> Disadvantages
	  <ul>
	       <li> costs money and takes time to obtain
	       <li> totality of invention is disclosed once patent is
		    issued (compare with trade secret)
	  </ul>
     <li> Noteworthy examples
	  <ul>
	       <li> Cadtrak - us patent 4197590 - write directly from
		    memory to display - and XOR.
	       <li> Unisys - us patent 4558302 - LWZ compression patent -
		    compuserve GIF format!
	       <LI> Pardo and Landau - 4398249 - concept of an array of
		    formulas which would enable businessmen to create their
		    own business applications - spreadsheet? - rejected by
		    PTO as mathematical algorithm and therefore
		    unpatentable.  (Thank goodness for lotus 1-2-3.)
	  </ul>
</ul>

<h3>Copyright legalities</h3>

<ul>
     <li> Copyright arises on the expression of ideas and thoughts in
	  words, sentences, paragraphs, programs, pictures, or any other
	  method of conveying throughts or ideas - works of authorship.
     <li> Copyright protects the means or manner in which an idea is
	  expressed, not the idea itself - this is the fundamental
	  difference from patent law.
     <li> Copyright of both published and unpublished works.
     <li> Grants exclusive rights to the reproduction, preparation of
	  derivative works, distribution, public performance, or display.
     <li> 50 years beyond life of author, or for 75 years if work is owned
	  by author's employer
     <li> Things protected include:
	  <ul>
	       <li> literary works, musical works, dramatic works,
		    pantomimes and choreography, pictorial, graphical, and
		    sculptural works, motion pictures, video games,
		    computer and other AV works, sound recordings, and
		    architectural works.
	  </ul>
     <li> Copyright notice - placing word Copyright or the circle-C symbol
	  together with authors name and date of authorship where it may be
	  discovered by reasonable inspection.
     <li> Copyright registration - formal registration of copyrighted works
	  iwth the US copyright office.
     <li> notice and registration not necessary for protection - protection
	  is automatically granted &quot;as ink flows from pen to
	  paper&quot;, but notice and registration gives additional
	  protection such as damages and attorney fees.
     <li> Infringement:
	  <ul>
	       <li> arise from access to original author's work
	       <li> must display degree of similarity
	  </ul>
	  Thus independently developed works, or sufficiently different
	  work is not infringement.
     <li> Notable cases:
	  <ul>
	       <li> Computer Associates vs. Altai - established three step
		    process for infringement detection - abstraction,
		    filtration, and comparison.  Abstraction - separate
		    ideas from expression (boy meets girl vs. shakespeare
		    text).  filtration - eliminate permitted expression
		    (licensed, common knowledge, hardware requirements)
		    from consideration.  comparison - detect similarities
		    on remaining work.
	       <li> Apple vs. Microsoft/HP - GUI was tested.  Apple
		    macintosh &quot;look and feel&quot;.  Court rejected
		    look and feel, but instead broke Apple GUI into more
		    than 180 pictorial elements such as overlapping
		    windows, zooming windows, etc. and granted copyright
		    protection to some of those (but not most).  Example -
		    difference between Windows and Macintosh menu - drag
		    vs. click and drag.
	       <li> Lotus vs. Borland - lotus 123 command hierarchy (menu
		    structure).  Court reversed infringement decision on
		    basis that menu structure is analgous to buttons on VCR
		    rather than the labels on the buttons, and as such was
		    a mode of operation rather than an expression.
	       <li> Atari vs. Ninendo - decompilation is fair use, as long
		    as licence obtained for work, decompilation is only way
		    to extract uncopyrightable ideas and functionality, and
		    protected information in reverse engineered program
		    isn't carried forth into derived program.
	  </ul>
     <li> Advantages:
	  <ul>
	       <li> easy to obtain
	       <li> no substantive examination required
	       <li> costs are minimal
	  </ul>
     <li> Disavantages:
	  <ul>
	       <li> independent development is permitted
	       <li> reverse engineering is not protected against
	       <li> burden of proof on copyright holder to show infringement
	  </ul>
</ul>

<h2>The Ethics of the matter</h2>

<ul>
     <li> natural rights argument for ownership of software
	  <ul>
	       <li> person has moral right to what he produces
	       <li> right should be enforced by law
	       <li> right to profit from your own creation
	       <li> is this an artificial human construct?
	  </ul>
     <li> consequentialist argument
	  <ul>
	       <li> unless people get ownership rights, will not invest
		    time, energy, and resources to develop
	       <li> shown to be false
		    <ul>
			 <li> WELL development as example - betterment of
			      community
			 <li> Netscape example - gave away software to
			      obtain market dominance and name recognition
		    </ul>
	  </ul>
     <li> pragmatics of look and feel
	  <ul>
	       <li> look and feel will not protect small companies -
		    protects large - large company can just design a
		    different interface and win by marketing strength;  if
		    large company has copyright, can lock out small company
	       <li> diversity of interfaces is not desirable - car dash
		    example.
	       <li> inhibits useful innovation - best changes are small,
		    derivative ones
	  </ul>
</ul>

<H2>The Copyright Grab paper</H2>

<ol>
     <li> Give copyright owners control over every use of copyrighted works
	  in digital form by interpreting existing law as being violated
	  whenever
	  users make even temporary reproductions of works in the random access
	  memory of their computer.
	  <p>
	  Argument: Knowingly omits reference to the legislative
	  history of the current copyright statute, in which Congress
	  specifically stated that the temporary storage of a copyrighted
	  work in a
	  computer's memory should not be regarded as an infringing
	  reproduction
	  <P>
	  
     <li> Give copyright owners control over every transmission of works in
	  digital form by amending the copyright statute so that digital
	  transmissions will be regarded as distributions of copies to the
	  public
	  <P>
	  Argument: maximalists want to be able to control all performances
	  and displays of copyrighted works, not just the public
	  performances and public displays that the existing law grants to
	  copyright owners
	  <p>
	  
     <li> Eliminate fair-use rights whenever a use might be licensed.
	  <p>
	  Argument: &quot;The Court held that it was fair use for consumers
	  to copy programs off the air for time-shifting purposes. Indeed,
	  the Court said that private, noncommercial copying should be
	  presumed fair use.&quot; - Universal/Disney vs. Sony.
	  <P>
	  Argument: The notion that fair-use rights apply only when no
licensing market exists is neither historically accurate nor good public
policy. It ignores some important free speech and related public interest
functions of fair use.
	  <P>

     <li> Deprive the public of the "first sale" rights it has long enjoyed
	  in the print world
	  <P>
	  Argument: If the white paper had wanted to retain the balance of
interests embodied in current law, it would have suggested that the
intermediate copying necessary to effect a user's first-sale rights should
be regarded as a fair use under precedents such as Sega v. Accolade.
	  <p>
	  
     <li> Attach copyright management information to digital copies of a
work, ensuring that publishers can track every use made of digital copies
and trace where each copy resides on the network and what is being done
with it at any time
	  <P>
	  Argument: Some favor making these systems "dumb," while others
favor making them "smart." Dumb systems would simply identify the work with
a digital equivalent of the ISBN numbers used in the book world
today. Smart ones would, among other things, have the ability to secretly
report back to the copyright owner via the network on what the user was
doing with the work, and the ability to search the consumer's hard disk and
report back on what else was there.
	<P>
	  
     <li> Protect every digital copy of every work technologically (by
encryption, for example) and make illegal any attempt to circumvent that
protection;
	  <P>
	  Argument: the language of this proposed law is so broad and so
vague that it can be construed as outlawing many activities widely believed
to be lawful. For example, some software publishers will argue that the
decompilation of mass-marketed software in order to get access to interface
information violates this provision.
	  <P>
	  
     <li> Force online service providers to become copyright police,
charged with implementing pay-per-use rules.
	  <p>
	  Argument: ignores the privacy interests of users, as well as
serious questions about whether it is technically feasible for online
services with millions of subscribers to do the continuous monitoring of
user accounts that copyright owners might like.
	  <P>
	  The white paper acts as though the interests of copyright owners
so override other, competing interests that it isn't even worth mentioning
what the other interests are, let alone trying to balance them against the
copyright owner interests.
	  <P>
	  
     <li> Teach the new copyright rules of the road to children throughout
their years at school.
	  <P>
	  Argument(?): &quot;The general theme of these lessons, in order
not to be too negative, would be, "Just say yes" to licensing. (It actually
says this.)&quot;
</ul>

<H2>Selling Wine without Bottles</h2>

<ul>
     <li> Throughout the darker parts of human history, the possession and
distribution of property was a largely military matter. "Ownership" was
assured those with the nastiest tools, whether fists or armies, and the
most resolute will to use them. Property was the divine right of thugs.

     <li> Alvin Toffler and the notion of waves..
	  
     <li> The First Wave was agriculturally based and required law to order
ownership of the principal source of production, land.

     <li> In the Second Wave, manufacturing became the economic mainspring,
and the structure of modern law grew around the centralized institutions
which needed protection for their reserves of capital, manpower, and
hardware.

     <li> In the Third Wave we have now entered, information to a large
extent replaces land, capital, and hardware.  The Third Wave is likely to
bring a fundamental shift in the purposes and methods of law which will
affect far more than simply those statutes which govern intellectual
property.

     <li> Claims:
	  <ul>
	       <li> information technology is fundamentally unsuited to
		    existing IP law because IP law protects forms and not
		    concepts - expressions but not ideas
	       <li> in absence of adequate law, returning to days in which
		    ownership enforced by military protection - now with
		    lawyers and FUD.
	       <li> new economy of the mind emerging - information itself
		    intrinsically frees itself of bounds.  Propagation of
		    information benefits whole society, as well as those
		    that make it free.  New economy based on relationship,
		    rather than possesion - service rather than product.
	  </ul>
     <li> Information classifications
	  <ul>
	       <li> &quot;information is an activity&quot; - a verb, not a
		    noun - an action that occupies time, not space (the
		    dance, not the dancer, the pitch, not the baseball).
		    It is experienced, not possessed (sharing doesn't
		    deplete your own copy).
	       <li> &quot;information is a life form&quot; -
		    self-reproducing (memes), they adapt to their
		    environment, they persist.
	       <li> &quot;information is a relationship&quot; - the context
		    in which information is shared defines the content of
		    the information (terminology, culture, interest, ...) -
		    familiarity has more value than scarcity (grateful dead
		    concert tour example).
	  </ul>
</ul>
