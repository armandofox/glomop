<h2><center>Society, Computing and Communications - an Overview <BR>
CS39C Spring 1997</center></h2>

<hr>

Associated with the massive technological revolution of computing and
<img align=left width=172 height=205 src="gifs/globe.gif">
communications has been a great sociological upheaval.  The massive
communications infrastructure of the 20th century has effectively turned
the world into a global village, eliminating the geographic barriers that
were previously insurmountable to everyday people.  Suddenly it has become
possible for virtually anyone to influence thousands of other people; in
this way, the communications infrastructure can be used as a publication
and distribution medium.  The means are now available so that anybody with
an opinion can publish it, and have anyone who so chooses listen to it.

<P>

Countless special interest groups and electronic communities have sprung up
in the past decade, connecting like-minded people in a forum to discuss
extremely specialized topics <i>in real time</i>, which is a manner that
was previously impossible.  The computing and communications infrastructure
is a powerful tool that is changing the way people all over the world live
and interact.

<BR CLEAR=ALL><P>

The most recent, high visibility instantiation of this infrastructure has
been the Internet.  Neal Stephenson, the author of a best-selling
cyberspace novel called &quot;Snow Crash&quot;, refers to the Internet in
the following way:

<BLOCKQUOTE><B>
You've probably also heard that the Internet is a vast and diffuse electronic
web, a "network of networks" that spans the planet, encompassing a rapidly
growing number of computers. And you may have heard that the Internet will
deeply change politics, culture and the fabric of society--if not, indeed, the
very metaphysics of human existence. Then again, you may have heard that the
Internet is just another passing craze.
</B></BLOCKQUOTE>

Although few people can agree on how the Internet has and will continue to
impact people and society, the one thing most everyone agrees on is that it
cannot help but have impact.  The following global map shows the
distribution of internet-connected computers around the world:

The ability to communicate is a powerful tool.  Like any powerful tool, it
can be abused, not only by individuals, but also by organizations,
companies, and even governments.  The communications infrastructure is
responsible for a massive increase in the flow of information around the
world.  From personal data to government policy, private phone calls to
bank balances, and medical imaging to pornography, information of all types
is being shipped across cities and across national boundaries.  Should this
flow of information be legislated or monitored?  Should people be
guaranteed individual privacy, even though this communications
infrastructure could be abused for nefarious means such as organized
terrorism?  Does the security of nations outweigh the rights of the
individual?

<P>

In this part of the course, we'll discuss many of these societal issues
that have suddenly been thrust into the public eye and made all the more
relevant and urgent because of this increased ability of people to
communicate.  Specifically, we'll focus on:

<UL>
     <LI> <B>Society in the Large</B>
	  <P>
	  Bulletin boards, MUDS, the WELL, Internet Relay Chat, and USENET:
	  the growth of the virtual community.  Hackers, cyberpunks,
	  phreaks, and net-cops: cultures and countercultures.  Publishing
	  and political action.
	  <P>
     <LI> <B>Cryptography</B>
	  <P>
	  An overview of the art and history of cryptography.
	  <P>
     <LI> <B>The Freedom of the Individual</B>
	  <P>
	  All about privacy and anonymity.  Key escrow (Clipper) and
	  cryptographic export legislation.
	  <P>
     <LI> <B>Intellectual Property</B>
	  <P>
	  Do I own a copyright on this web page?  Should you be allowed
	  to duplicate it at will?  Can programs or algorithms be patented?
	  <P>
     <LI> <B>Cyber-Economics</B>
	  <P>
	  Digital cash and money transfers.  (<i>Guest lecturer: <a
