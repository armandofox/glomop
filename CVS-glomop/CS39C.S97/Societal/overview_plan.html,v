<h1>Overview of Societal Issues</h1>

<h2>Society in the Large</h2>

<ul>
     <li> the growth of the virtual community
	  <ul>
	       <li> early days of bulletin board systems (BBS's)
	       <li> FIDOnet
	       <li> USENET
	       <li> mailing lists
	       <li> IRC
	       <li> chatrooms, VRML rooms, and telepresence
	       <li> the WEB
	  </ul>
     <li> emergence of cultures
	  <ul>
	       <li> Hackers and crackers
	       <li> Phone phreaks
	       <li> Cyberpunks
	       <li> Cypherpunks
	       <li> Net.police
	  </ul>
     <li> digital publishing
	  <ul>
	       <li> the magazine phenomenon
	       <li> illicit information - pirating, pornography
	       <li> suppressed information (Tiennamen square, Karla Homolka)
	       <li> political action (EFF, ...)
	  </ul>
</ul>

<h2>Cryptography and the Freedom of the Individual</h2>

<ul>
     <li> new capabilities
	  <ul>
	       <li> communicate on wide scale
	       <li> data gathering on a wide scale - www.doubleclick.com
	  </ul>
     <li> new threats
	  <ul>
	       <li> evil forces - crackers, packet sniffers, disgruntled
		    sysadmins
	       <li> beaurocrats - government (NSA), university (email policy)
	       <li> insecure technologies being inappropriately used
		    (credit card numbers over the net)
	  </ul>
     <li> tools for individuals
	  <ul>
	       <li> encryption (PGP, SSL, SSH)
	       <li> anonymization (remailers, web anonymizers)
	       <li> authentication (X.509 certificate infrastructure)
	  </ul>
     <li> but here comes the government
	  <ul>
	       <li> ITAR, EAR
	       <li> export regs
	  </Ul>
</ul>

<h2>Cyber-Economics</h2>

<ul>
     <li> ATMs, EFTs, money is purely electronic _now_.
     <li> digital cash technologies - why?
	  <ul>
	       <li> increased security (cred card bad, math good)
	       <li> smart money (earmark money for certain uses)
	       <li> money = any unit (food stamps, frequent flyer miles, ...)
	       <li> convenience (easy to transport and carry)
	       <li> digital economy (eliminate middlemen)
	  </ul>
     <li> digital cash - essentials
	  <ul>
	       <li> security (encryption)
	       <li> authentication (know who buyers are)
	       <li> dispute resolution (trusted agents)
	  </ul>
     <li> what about traceability?
	  <ul>
	       <li> my buying habits can be private
	       <li> dossier effect - demographics, mailing lists
	       <li> money laundering, criminal activity
	       <li> taxation?
	       <li> micropayments
	       <li> who can issue cash?
	  </ul>
</ul>

<h2>Intellectual Property</h2>

<BLOCKQUOTE> The riddle is this: if our property can be infinitely
reproduced and instantaneously distributed all over the planet without
cost, without our knowledge, without its even leaving our possession, how
can we protect it? How are we going to get paid for the work we do with our
minds? And, if we can't get paid, what will assure the continued creation
and distribution of such work?</BLOCKQUOTE>

<ul>
     <li> copyrightability - ideas are collective property of humanity, but
	  expression of ideas or implementations are copyrightable.
     <li> protection of physical expression
     <li> the bottle was protected, not the wine
</ul>

<ul>
     <li> digital world - what about physicality?
     <li> broadcast media - real start of this conundrum
     <li> lack of geographic boundaries to contain scene of crime - piracy
	  in China, for example
</ul>

<ul>
     <li> protection of rights - historically, property adheres to those
	  who can muster the largest armies, unless government intervention
	  to protect and therefore encourage individuals.  This time the
	  armies consist of lawyers.
</ul>
