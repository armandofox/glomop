<H2>A Brief Timeline of Cryptography</H2>

<UL>

<p><li> about 1900 BC; civ; Kahn p.71;

an Egyptian scribe used non-standard hieroglyphs in an inscription.  Kahn
lists this as the first documented example of written cryptography.

<p><li> 487 BC; govt; Kahn p.82;

the Greeks used a device called the ``skytale'' -- a staff around which a
long, thin strip of leather was wrapped and written on.  The leather was
taken off and worn as a belt.  Presumably, the recipient would have a
matching staff and the encrypting staff would be left home.

<p><li> 50-60 BC; govt; Kahn p.83;

<B>Julius Caesar</B> (100-44 BC) used a simple substitution with the normal
alphabet (just shifting the letters a fixed amount) in government
communciations.  This cipher was less strong than ATBASH, by a small
amount, but in a day when few people read in the first place, it was good
enough.  He also used tansliteration of Latin into Greek letters and a number
of other simple ciphers.

<P><LI> 725-790?; govt/(civ); Kahn p.97;

<B>Abu `Abd al-Rahman al-Khalil ibn Ahmad ibn `Amr ibn Tammam al Farahidi
al-Zadi al Yahmadi</b> wrote a (now lost) book on cryptography, inspired
by his solution of a cryptogram in Greek for the Byzantine emperor.  His
solution was based on known (correctly guessed) plaintext at the message
start -- a standard cryptanalytic method, used even in WW-II against
Enigma messages.

     <p><li> 1412; civ; Kahn p.95-6;

<b>Shihab al-Din abu `l-`Abbas Ahmad ben `Ali ben Ahmad `Abd Allah
al-Qalqashandi</b> wrote &quot;Subh al-a `sha&quot;, a 14-volume Arabic
encyclopedia which included a section on cryptology.  This information was
attributed to <b>Taj ad-Din `Ali ibn ad-Duraihim ben Muhammad ath-Tha`alibi
al-Mausili</b> who lived from 1312 to 1361 but whose writings on cryptology
have been lost. The list of ciphers in this work included both substitution
and transposition and, for the first time, a cipher with multiple
substitutions for each plaintext letter.  Also traced to Ibn al-Duraihim is
an exposition on and worked example of cryptanalysis, including the use of
tables of letter frequencies and sets of letters which can not occur
together in one word.

	  <a href="gifs/oath.jpg">Oath of secrecy</a>

<p><li> 1790's; civ/govt; Kahn p.192, Cryptologia v.5 No.4 pp.193-208;

<b>Thomas Jefferson</b>, possibly aided by <b>Dr. Robert Patterson</b> (a
mathematician at U. Penn.), invented his wheel cipher.  This was
re-invented in several forms later and used in WW-II by the US Navy as the
Strip Cipher, M-138-A.

<B>Charles Babbage</b> seems to have re-invented the wheel cipher.

<P><li> 1917; gov;

     <B>Ambassador Bernstorff</B> of the German government sent the
     following encrypted &quot;Zimmerman Telegram&quot; message to the
     German minister &quot;von Eckhardt&quot; in Mexico city:

     <P>

     <a href="gifs/zimmerman.jpg">encrypted</a>

     <p>

     <a href="gifs/plaintext.html">plaintext</a>
     
<p><li> 1919; civ; Kahn p.422;

<B>Arvid Gerhard Damm</b> applied for a patent in Sweden for a mechanical
rotor cipher machine.  This machine grew into a family of cipher machines
under the direction of <B>Boris Caesar Wilhelm Hagelin</b> who took over
the business and was the only one of the commercial cryptographers of this
period to make a thriving business.  After the war, a Swedish law which
enabled the government to appropriate inventions it felt important to
defense caused Hagelin to move the company to Zug Switzerland where it was
incorporated as Crypto AG.  The company is still in operation, although
facing controversy for having allegedly weakened a cipher product for sale
to Iran.

<p><li> 1927-33; civ; Kahn p.802ff;

users of cryptography weren't limited to legitimate bankers, lovers,
experimenters, etc.  There were also a handful of criminals.  ``The
greatest era of international smuggling -- Prohibition -- created the
greatest era of criminal cryptology.'' <i>[p.817]</i> To this day, the FBI
runs a cryptanalytic office to deal with criminal cryptography.  [As of
Kahn's writing in 1967, that office was located at 215 Pennsylvania Avenue
SE, Washington DC.]

     <blockquote>

``A retired lieutenant commander of the Royal Navy devised the systems for
Consolidated Exporters' Pacific operation, though its Gulf and Atlantic
groups made up their own as needed.

<P>

``His name was unknown but his cryptologic expertise was apparent.  The
smugglers' systems grew increasingly more complicated. &quot;Some of these
are of a complexity never even attempted by any government for its most
secret communications,&quot; wrote <B>Mrs. [Elizebeth Smith] Friedman</b>
in a report in mid-1930.  &quot;At no time during the World War, when
secret methods of communication reached their highest development, were
there used such involved ramifications as are to be found in some of the
correspondence of West Coast rum running vessels.&quot; '' <i>[p.804]</i>

</blockquote>

<p><li> 1933-45; govt; Kahn p.422 (and many others);

The Enigma machine was not a commercial success but it was taken over and
improved upon to become the cryptographic workhorse of Nazi Germany.  [It
was broken by the Polish mathematician, <B>Marian Rejewski</b>, based only
on captured ciphertext and one list of three months worth of daily keys
obtained through a spy.  Continued breaks were based on developments during
the war by <b>Alan Turing, Gordon Welchman</b> and others at Bletchley Park
in England.]

     <p>
     
     <a href="gifs/rotor.jpg">enigma</a>

<p><li> 1976; civ/govt; FIPS PUB-46;

a design by IBM, based on the Lucifer cipher and with changes (including
both S-box improvements and reduction of key size) by the US NSA, was
chosen to be the U.S. Data Encryption Standard.  It has since found
worldwide acceptance, largely because it has shown itself strong against 20
years of attacks.  Even some who believe it is past its useful life use it
as a component -- e.g., of 3-key triple-DES.

<p><li> 1976; civ; Diffie;

<B>Whitfield Diffie</b> and <b>Martin Hellman</b> published ``New
Directions in Cryptography'', introducing the idea of public key
cryptography.  They also put forth the idea of authentication by powers of
a one way function, now used in the S/Key challenge/response utility.  They
closed their paper with an observation for which this timeline web page
gives detailed evidence: ``Skill in production cryptanalysis has always
been heavily on the side of the professionals, but innovation, particularly
in the design of new types of cryptographic systems, has come primarily
from amateurs.''

<p><li> April 1977; civ; Shamir;

Inspired by the Diffie-Hellman paper and acting as complete novices in
cryptography, <B>Ronald L. Rivest, Adi Shamir</b> and <B>Leonard M.
Adleman</b> had been discussing how to make a practical public key system.
One night in April, Ron Rivest was laid up with a massive headache and the
RSA algorithm came to him.  He wrote it up for Shamir and Adleman and sent
it to them the next morning.  It was a practical public-key cipher for both
confidentiality and digital signatures, based on the difficulty of
factoring large numbers.  They submitted this to Martin Gardner on April 4
for publication in Scientific American.  It appeared in the September, 1977
issue.  The Scientific American article included an offer to send the full
technical report to anyone submitting a self-addressed, stamped envelope.
There were thousands of such requests, from all over the world.

<P>

Someone at NSA objected to the distribution of this report to foreign
nationals and for a while, RS&amp;A suspended mailings -- but when NSA
failed to respond to inquiries asking for the legal basis of their request,
RS&amp;A resumed mailings.  Adi Shamir believes this is the origin of the
current policy [as of August 1995] that technical reports or papers can be
freely distributed.  [Note: two international journals, ``Cryptologia'' and
``The Journal of Cryptology'' were founded shortly after this attempt by
NSA to restrain publication.]

<P>

Contrary to rumor, RS&amp;A apparently had no knowledge of ITAR or patent
secrecy orders.  They did not publish before applying for international
patents because they wanted to avoid such restraints on free expression but
rather because they were not thinking about patents for the algorithm.
They just wanted to get the idea out.

<p><li> 1990; civ; IACR90;

<B>Charles H. Bennett, Gilles Brassard</b> et al. published their
experimental results on Quantum Cryptography, which uses single photons to
communicate a stream of key bits for some later Vernam encipherment of a
message (or other uses).  Assuming the laws of quantum mechanics hold,
Quantum Cryptography provides not only secrecy but a positive indication of
eavesdropping and a measurement of the maximum number of bits an
eavesdropper might have captured.  On the downside, QC currently requires a
fiber-optic cable between the two parties.

<p><li> 1991; civ; Garfinkel;

<b>Phil Zimmerman</b> released his first version of PGP (Pretty Good
Privacy) in response to the threat by the FBI to demand access to the
cleartext of the communications of citizens.  Although PGP offered little
beyond what was already available in products like Mailsafe from RSADSI,
PGP is notable because it was released as freeware and has become a
worldwide standard as a result.

		    <UL><LI>Objective jurisdiction. Your basic shot fired across
			 a frontier. Alice, standing in Mexico, shoots Bob, who
			 is standing in the
			 US. Alice can (and probably will) be prosecuted in the

			      pursued an anti-trust action against a foreign aluminum cartel based on the
			      <i>effect</i> their restraint of trade had on the US.<a href="#3">[3]</a>
			      The effects doctrine weakens the requirement for directness of the effect

				   personality <br>This covers
				   jurisdiction over crimes committed by nationals abroad and is implemented
				   in many different ways in different countries. It's most widely used
				   against diplomatic personnel (who generally have immunity where the crime
				   is committed). Rumor has it Germany is now using this doctrine to prosecute
				   Germans who deal drugs in Amsterdam or have sex with child prostitutes in
				   Thailand. While both activities are nominally illegal where the crime is
				   committed, the relevant laws go largely unenforced there.<p> <LI>Passive

					     cited, along with the effects doctrine, by US prosecutors in the
					     <i>Noriega</i><a href="#6">[6]</a><i> </i>case<i>.</i> Look for this
					     principle to be invoked against international software piracy rings.<p>
					<LI>Universal jurisdiction<br>It will probably be a long time before we
					     start seeing war crimes (flame war crimes?) on the net, but this handy
					     principle is used for sufficiently heinous crimes such as genocide which
					     are considered "universally abhorrent" and can be prosecuted
