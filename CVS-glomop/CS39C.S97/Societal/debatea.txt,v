@Affirmative constructive:

Mike - government to serve the people of the nation.  if government did
       not regulate info, national security may be compromised - political
       and economic implications.  Don't want rival governments snooping.

Benny- international, national, and local levels.  
       international: man indicted for slipping nukes into russia.  spies
       prevalent in every country - integral part of government.  job of
       government is to root out spies/counterspies.
       national level:  how many more oklahoma/NYC bombings do you want?
       mostly not individuals doing this destructive stuff.
       local level:  corruption everywhere in local level;  greater ability
       to prevent if can monitor communications.
       analogy:  government/citizen as parent/child relationship.  no
       parent is perfect, neither is government.  our country is republic -
       can mould is however we want

Dave-  government is only one we can trust to protect ourselves.  if we
       want to regulate ourselves, we should have right to do so.  hard
       to regulate - no way to control - child porno, terrorist plannings,
       must be put to a stop.  if government regulates this, it can
       protect against breakdowns in privacy between individuals and
       businesses.

       just because government protects security, doesn't mean monitor
       everything - purpose to prevent criminals from using tech against
       society.  example: France - any large problems?  possible for
       government to abuse, but it doesn't actually do so.

       governments right to protect increased in airports - high risk area
      - internet is another.

Cross-examination:

Tim-   what is definition of national security, in one sentence?

       Mike- safety of people in nation - keeping military secrets

       " " privacy and anonymity, in
       privacy - keeping info to self, anonymitiy - not let know who you
       are

       who is responsible for security, govt or individual?

       govt

       govt or indiv:  protect against spies?

       govt

       is united states resp or indiv for local corruption?

       local

       governt to citizen: parent to child?  communist or democracy?

       democracy

       democracy:  individual has natural rights before govt has right to
       take away?

       yes

Negative constructive:

Tim -  national security act of ??? - defines rights of citizens cannot be
       taken away unless prove that rights threaten sovereingty of US as
       nation

     - US government is responsible protect US not individual, without
       taking rights from citizen.
   
     - government employee: if puts media out for other government, govt
       must protect.  spies have been around before internet - internet
       merely another mechanism.  it is global, but so is telephone
       system.   why regulate more on internet than telephone network?

     - wiretaps can be gotten if evidence shows needs one.  Can trace
       location of hackers - cuckoo's egg - can trace spies - takedown as
       another example - hacker was using cellphone.  internet as
       unregulatable network is therefore false;  don't need to get rid of
       anonymity and privacy.

Tom -  government can't prevent bombings, terrorism.  impossible to have
       government keep up to date with tech - enemy will always have way to
       transport info, independent of whther there is government security.

Tim -  privacy - electronic cash - comm - pay with cash is natural right -
       freedom of speech - anonymity is a right.  speaking anonymously is
       not a threat to national security, hence government can't take right
       away - only can once done something wrong.  To regulate an unproven
       threat to US (have no evidence for this yet, except stupidity of
       government re: hackers) is silly.  Hackers are individuals -
       reponsible for own action.  Military installations as targets of
       hackers must defend themselves.

    -  if limit these rights, why can't they do that in other area?  Don't
       have "lithmus test" for figuring out when you can and can't take
       away individual rights.

Cross-Examination:

Dave - in many cases, cited constitution.  where does constitution give
       you right to anonymity and cash?

     - 1st, 4th amendments.  

     - but none actually give right to anonymity or to cash.

     - ?

     - impossible to keep up with tech.  shouldn't we try?

     - it means you should regulate. constitution doesn't define all
      rights - non definied

     - when try to regulate, only hurts regular people

     - not respons of indiv, but right of government.  is this not a
       means to protect government?

     - yes, but will take away rights of individual.  before protect
       govt, must protect rights of individual.  If not, back to orwellian
       nightmare.

Mike  - when talk about national security, if individual is intelligent,
        government wouldn't no about it.  hence, goverment would have to
        monitor individuals?

      - if murder kills somebody, do police officers have right to pick
        evidence before or after kills somebody?


Affirmative Rebuttal:

Dave -  example given:  governt can place wiretaps when necessary, so
        should be able to extend to internet.  gave examples: hackers
        being trace.  doesn't mean that every case with hacker can be and
        is trace - probably many cases that not aware of that people have
        gotten away.  wouldn't have if government could step in and
        regulate more fully.

Mike-   know can't get everybody.  but must reduce risk - reduce chance
        to disrupt national security.

Dave-   said 'governt protect rights of individuals rather than individuals
        themselves'.  why have police?  use to protect individual against
        abuses, e.g. stolen ccards.  protect individual, not control
        actions.  we are government, we choose what govt does.    we
        choose to protect ourselves.

Benny-  on security issue:  not saying give government carte blance to
        open up any letter, just give government ability.  how many
        criminals got away because not enough incriminating evidence 
        gathered?  government should have ability to easier access to info
        to incriminate individuals.

Dave-   said:  government can't listen in on any phone calls, so why
        internet?  reason:  internet different than phone call.  internet
        can be broadcast-  much easier for people to access info over
        internet than phone call.

Negative rebuttal:

Tim-    said: government designed to serve people, be parent, clean our
        diapers.  but:  government is not parent - it is there to protect
        our rights.  police will not stop me from burning myself on stove.
        police simply protect my rights, not me myself.  Police on
        internet? hah.

        said: give government ability, not carte blance.  but I don't trust
        government - watch the watcher - be careful of how many rights I
        give up to them.  is government's responsibility to protect itself.
        i don't have to give up my rights to privacy and anonymity 
        to help government.

        gathering evidence:  cannot conflict with my own rights.  I don't
        have to give up rights except in specific instances, when for
        the protection of my own rights.

        difference between phone and internet:  can use underlying
        mechanism to track down source, even if can't do it all time.
        
        murder:  lots of mechanisms to get rid of murder, but it still
        exists.  no matter what, badness will exist.  internet is 
        orthogonal to existence of badness, hence why treat differently?
        can send anonymous snail-mail.  why don't we regulate/invade
        all lettermail?

        oklahoma bombing:  mcveigh probably doesn't even know what
        internet is.  terrorism is people being malicious against US.
        regulating internet won't stop that from happening.  tim is not
        personally responsible for actions of terrorists - why should FBI
        read his email because bombers exist?

Amy:    purpose of constitution - protect individuals against government.
        14th amendment:  reserves rights yet to be defined by laws, hence
        individuals do have right to privacy and anonymity.

Tim:    France?  France has one of largest terrorist problems.  limiting
        privacy/anonymity has done nothing to help with terrorism problems.
  

Last affirmative rebuttal:

Benny-  opposition keeps bringing up topic internet.  we didn't.  internet
        is just medium.  we don't say regulate internet.  we want
        government to be able to investigate message, not medium.

Dave-   opposition: government needs to protect rights not individuals.
        this helps our own point:  our info should not be stolen, we should
        have right to be protected from criminal activity.  who else to 
        help but government?

    -   how else can government protect themselves but by regulating
        privacy and anonymity?

    -   just because fight against murder doesn't eliminate it, we must
        still fight it.  similarly, must take steps against crime on
        internet, even if doesn't solve crime.

    -   we don't propose reading every email message.  is difference
        between snailmail and internet.  mail goes to _one_ person.  on
        internet, broadcast.  dangerous information can be much more
        quickly disseminated.

    -   having FBI reading our email is unrealistic - not how government
        would regulate it.
