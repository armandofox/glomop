@Affirmative constructive:

  - Tom Sha - ethics in general - rightful credit, rightful dues
  - Kee     - protect individual in general - 
  - Eric    - future development,  more experimentation

Cross-examination:

  Roman - what did you mean by ethics in general?

Negative constructive:

  - Matt    - not equivalent, laws unenforcable (govt or copyright holders),
              piracy.  no copy protection - only laws can be deterrent
  - Roman   - ethical point of view - electronic media not as accessible or
              easy to use
  - Roger   - recognize difference between electronic/physical.  electronic:
              quality remains same on copies - most important difference -
              copies cheap


Cross-ex:

  - tom sha  - distinguished between media, but not for sake of protection.
               matt: two systems are so different because of media differences,
               laws need to take into account.
             - what new laws would you propose?
               roger: use better technology - but make sure credit is given
                      where it is do.
             - any specific alternatives?
               roger: in software piracy - curb using dongle - check for
                      presence of physical device
               matt:  smart card technology?  be part of program.   net
                      software - new ways to do online legitimacy checking
             - so eliminate privacy as alternative?
               matt: 
             - compromise right to privacy?
               matt: yes
             - track peoples activities?
               matt: only one copy of each serial number could be running


affirmative rebuttal:

   - tom sha   - rightful people should get credit for what they come up
                 with - use what we have in place today - existing laws
               - consider electronic media as physical media
               - in negative's alternative, revolutionary - create enormous
                 change in how we deal with protection of rights.  already
                 have system that we use - just continue using it? less money
                 from governments that we can use to foster more technology.
   - Eric      - unless natural monopoly, don't want big company to take
                 over- lots of small companies better
   - tom sha   - inaccessibility of electronic media - disagree!  easily
                 download software from net - cost of owning computer is not
                 beyond average person's scope - computer user pop getting
                 bigger
   - Kee       - just because hard to enforce doesn't mean throw out law.
                 build on current laws, think of new ways to enforce.

negative rebuttal:

   - Roman     - quit wasting our time and use current laws.  but internet
                 is worldwide - how can we possibly have law for entire
                 world?
               - already have physical media laws, more or less effective
                 in what they do.
               - electronic media _is not_ as accessible;  not as many people
                 have PC as have TV, Radio, or newspapers
               - not as accessible, so more difficult to manage, unexplored
                 space
   - Matt      - main point: not equivalent, as evident in current abuse
                 of copyright laws - billions $ lost to piracy, copying of
                 "protected" works.  More widespread than in physical world.
                 Not working in current state - need to be changed
   - Roger     - cannot build on globe-spanning legislation; must resort to
                 another approach


last affirmative rebuttal:

   - Tom       - there are instances of violation, but that doesn't mean
                 that electronic media is not equivalent to physical
                 media.  in current state, laws not world-applicable, but
                 UN as instance of international cooperation.  utilize
                 and adapt current laws to make world-applicable.
               - stated non-equivalence - "at this point, still not easily
                 accessible". Maybe not as this point, but soon will be, and
                 must take into account future.
   - Kee       - in future, will be computers everywhere - why wait until
                 future and let things get out of hand?  do it now.
   - Tom       - opposition says current laws don't work, but we haven't
                 heard any specific alternatives.
