We intend to begin unrestricted submarine warfare on the first of
February.  We shall endeavour in spite of this to keep the United States
of America neutral.  In the event of this not succeeding, we make Mexico
a proposal of alliance on the following basis.  Make war together, make
peace together, generous financial support and an understanding on our
part that Mexico is to reconquer the lost territory in Texas, New
Mexico, and Arizona.  Please call the President's attention to the fact
that the ruthless employment of our submarines now offers the prospect
of compelling England, in months, to make peace.
