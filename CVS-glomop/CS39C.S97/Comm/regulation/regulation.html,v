<H1>The International Telegraph Union</H1>

<P><HR ALIGN=LEFT></P>

<H4>Early Beginnings</H4>

<H5>Original Motivation</H5>

<P>European nations wanting to use telegraphs for international communications</P>

<P><STRONG>1849</STRONG>: First international agreement between Austria
and Prussia; negotiation of common standards and tariffs.</P>

<P><STRONG>1851</STRONG>: Similar agreement reached between Belgium and
France.</P>

<P>Various countries join the two different unions</P>

<P><STRONG>1865</STRONG>: International Telegraph Union founded at a conference
in Paris</P>

<P>A uniform telegraph standard determined. Morse code to be used for International
transmission.</P>

<P><STRONG>1903</STRONG>: ITU begins to draft regulations for international
telephone service (note that phone was invented in 1877).</P>

<H5>Radio Regulation</H5>

<P><STRONG>1903</STRONG>: Beginning efforts to regulate maritime radio communications</P>

<P>Berlin: Preliminary Conference Concerning Wireless Telegraphy, nine nations
attend including U.S.</P>

<P><STRONG>1906</STRONG>: Berlin Radiotelegraph Conference--29 member countries
form the International Radiotelegraph Union;</P>

<P>Formulated the basic regulatory principles still in common use today:</P>

<UL>
  <LI>grouping of services into dedicated frequency bands 
  <LI>national allocations must notify a central registration agency--the
  Berne Bureau
</UL>

<P>Partitioned spectrum frequencies below 188 kHz for long distance communications
and frequencies between 188 kHz and 500 kHz for military use.</P>

<P><STRONG>1912</STRONG>: Radiotelegraph Conference in London</P>

<P>New services like time and weather broadcasts assigned below 188 kHz;
amateur use above 3 MHz--then considered useless!</P>

<P>Focus on more spectrum efficient methods of transmission--replacement
of spurious spark gap transmitters by frequency-stable tube-based systems.</P>

<P><STRONG>1920</STRONG>: Washington Preliminary World Conference on Electrical
Communications</P>

<P>Proposed to merge telegraph and radiotelegraph conventions into a single
Universal Electrical Communications Union. Proposed a spectrum allocation
process that would require international approval before use. Created the
blueprint for the current International Telecommunications Union.</P>

<P><STRONG>1927</STRONG>: Radiotelegraph Union meeting in Washington</P>

<P>80 countries participate. Broadened responsibility beyond maritime transmitters
to all radio transmitters. First comprehensive Table of Allocations. Formation
of Radio Technical Consulting Committee (CCIR) to study technical issues.</P>

<P><STRONG>1932</STRONG>: Joint Telegraph and Radiotelegraph Conference
in Madrid</P>

<P>Creation of the International Telecommunications Union (ITU), spanning
radio, telephone, and telegraph.</P>

<P><STRONG>1947</STRONG>: ITU Conference, Atlantic City</P>

<P>Becomes a specialized agency of the United Nations. Only sovereign countries
become full members, one vote per country independent of size.</P>

<P><STRONG>Today</STRONG>: 166 member countries, 300 non-government agencies
(&quot;recognized private operating agencies,&quot; scientific, industrial,
and international organizations)</P>

<H4>Regulatory History of the Telephone System</H4>

<P>Western Union holds virtual monopoly for long distance communications
in the US. Refuses to buy Bell's telephony patents because it believes that
one of its own employees hold a patent for the telephone. Bell wins patent
infringement lawsuit in 1879, giving him complete control of the telephone
industry. Western Union forced to sell its telephone network to Bell, as
well as its Western Electric manufacturing concern in 1881.</P>

<P><STRONG>1885</STRONG>: Bell forms AT&amp;T to provide long distance services
between local exchanges.</P>

<P><STRONG>1907</STRONG>: AT&amp;T gradually loses control of the telephone
network. By this date, it controls only 51% of the network.</P>

<P>T. Vail, President of AT&amp;T, and banker J. P. Morgan purchase independent
telephone companies. Pressured them to knuckle under or have their long
distance service cut-off. Companies sue AT&amp;T.</P>

<P>Interstate Commerce Commission assumes regulatory role for interstate
telephony.</P>

<P>Vail proposes the concept of regulated monopoly. State lawmakers establish
own regulatory control. Prohibit competitive provision of local-exchange
services to avoid wasteful duplication and &quot;cream skimming&quot; and
to insure universal service. State regulatory commissions control telephone
rates.</P>

<P><STRONG>1934</STRONG>: Establishment of Federal Communication Commission</P>

<P>Controls interstate and international communications. <EM>Universal service</EM>
is identified as the primary goal of telecommunications policy.</P>

<P>By 1956, Bell System has complete control of the US telecommunications
infrastructure.</P>

<P><STRONG>1940s</STRONG>: Bell System seeks to monopolize mobile communications
market.</P>

<P><STRONG>1940</STRONG>: First 2-way mobile radio connected to phone system
in NY; rapid growth in the number of mobile users from about 86,000 in 1940
to 695,000 in 1948.</P>

<P><STRONG>1949</STRONG>: FCC does not allow Bell System to establish a
&quot;natural&quot; monopoly. Permits other companies to provide radio-operated
services.</P>

<P><STRONG>1949</STRONG>: First federal anti-trust suit against AT&amp;T.
Goal was to separate AT&amp;T from Western Electric.</P>

<P>Resolved in <STRONG>1956</STRONG>--AT&amp;T focuses on common carrier
services and grants licenses to its competitors. Consent decree no longer
allows Western Electric to manufacture mobile equipment. It is restricted
to selling equipment to the Bell System. This gives a big boost to Motorola
in mobile communications. (AT&amp;T also restricted from data processing
business).</P>

<P><STRONG>1966</STRONG>: FCC investigates whether Bell Systems should be
allowed to enter data processing market.</P>

<P><STRONG>1971</STRONG>: Common carriers allowed to enter data processing,
but only through arms length subsidiary. At same time FCC allowed common
carriers to provide data and specialized communications services.</P>

<P>Example: microwave transmission systems for bypassing AT&amp;T long distance
network ok'd in 1959.</P>

<P><STRONG>1969</STRONG>: MCI (Microwave Communications Inc.) voice transmission
over microwave links between St. Louis and Chicago. Many companies get into
this business throughout 1970s.</P>

<P><STRONG>1976</STRONG>: FCC reexamines whether Bell System should be allowed
to enter data processing market.</P>

<P><STRONG>1980</STRONG>: FCC's final decision--beginnings of deregulation.
&quot;Enhanced&quot; services (those that add, change, or restructure information)
no longer regulated. <STRONG>1968</STRONG>: non-Western Electric equipment
could be attached to the phone network (famous Carterphone decision--2-way
radio link to telephone system); by 1980, customer premise equipment market
completely deregulated. AT&amp;T, GTE, and others could enter computer and
data processing systems and services.</P>

<H5>Divestiture of AT&amp;T</H5>

<P><STRONG>1974</STRONG>: Second anti-trust case against AT&amp;T--Separation
of AT&amp;T, Western Electric, Regional Bell Operating Companies (RBOCs)</P>

<UL>
  <LI>RBOCs provide equal access to all interexchange carriers 
  <LI>RBOCs cannot get into long distance, data service businesses, or manufacturing
  
  <LI>AT&amp;T can offer computer and related products &amp; services without
  restriction 
  <LI>RBOCs get the free cellular telephone licenses (AT&amp;T puts together
  cellular network through acquisition of McCaw Cellular) 
  <LI>Bellcore formed to oversee the evolution of the telephone network 
  <LI>Goes into effect 1 January 1984 as &quot;Modified Final Judgement&quot;
  or MFJ
</UL>

<H5>Today</H5>

<P>AT&amp;T has been a disaster in the computer business. Because it both
provides services and manufactures equipment, it is its own most serious
competitor. RBOCs less willing to purchase equipment from their own service
rival.</P>

<P>RBOCs anxious to get into information services (e.g., video-on-demand).
Fiercely competitive with each other, no longer interested in collaborative
research via Bellcore.</P>

<UL>
  <LI>AT&amp;T splits into three separate businesses:
  <UL>
    <LI>NCR gets the computer business ($8 billion) 
    <LI>AT&amp;T retains the long distance services and wireless communications
    ($49 billion) 
    <LI>Lucent gets the telephone and equipment manufacturing components ($20
    billion)
  </UL>
  <LI>Research Laboratories change too:
  <UL>
    <LI>Bell Labs splits into AT&amp;T Laboratories and Lucent Bell Laboratories.
    
    <LI>Bellcore is sold to SAIC. Continues to play a national security and
    emergency preparedness obligations imposed by MFJ. However, future role
    in telecommunications industry is unclear.
  </UL>
</UL>

<P>US Telecomm Act of 1996</P>

<UL>
  <LI>Long distance carriers can provide local phone service 
  <LI>Local carriers no longer regulated as monopolies, can offer long distance
  services 
  <LI>Cable TV companies can offer telephony and information services 
  <LI>Telephone companies can carry entertainment and information services
  into homes 
  <LI>Media companies can hold assets in multiple service areas 
  <LI>RBOCs in competition with each other for deployment of services. Competition
  in providing local loop services is now opened up. 
  <LI>Multiple &quot;wires&quot; into the home: telephone, cable, wireless.
  
  <LI>Convergence:
  <UL>
    <LI>More than half of the bits traveling over the digital phone network
    are data bits, not voice bits 
    <LI>Telephony over the Internet (IP Dialtone) 
    <LI>WebTV: Internet on a TV 
    <LI>Telephony over cable TV 
    <LI>Internet over cable TV 
    <LI>Wireless local loop
  </UL>
</UL>

<P>Global Developments</P>

<UL>
  <LI>European Union: relinquish state monopolies on voice and infrastructure
  by January 1998
  <UL>
    <LI>Deutsche Telekom goes private, French Telecom sells off 49%
  </UL>
  <LI>Japan: NTT also splitting into long distance service provider and two
  regional companies handling local service

<P>* Note that some of these statistics can change very quickly. Cellular
phone use grew to 10 million subscribers in Japan by March 1996 and more
than 20 million by October 1996, due to rapidly declining costs for cellular
phones and services. The turnaround has been accelerated by the recent deregulation
of the Japanese cellular telephone market and the recent introduction of
personal communication services (called &quot;Personal Handyphone System&quot;
in Japan).</P>
