<H1>Packet Switching and the Internet</H1>

<P><HR ALIGN=LEFT></P>

<H4>Introduction</H4>

<P>Original need for survivable command and control systems in the cold
war era. Early contributors were drawn from the ranks of defense contractors,
federally funded think tanks, and universities: the RAND Corporation, Lincoln
Laboratories, MIT, UCLA, and Bolt Beranek and Newman (BBN), under Defense
Department funding.</P>

<P>In the wake of the Soviet Union's success in the launch of the Sputnik,
the Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA) of the Department of Defense
established in 1958 to make sure that in the future the U. S. would avoid
technological surprises. Under the early leadership of J. Licklider, Robert
Taylor, Larry Roberts, ARPA's Information Processing Technology Office provided
substantial funding for communications networking research.</P>

<P>1960s--Taylor and Roberts oversaw original development of the ARPANet;
1970s--Robert Kahn led the development of internetworking and extended the
packet switching concept to radio and satellite networks. 1980s--shift from
Defense-based sponsorship of the network, to the National Science Foundation
and its use to interconnect university-based researchers, and finally the
transition to private sector management of the Internet.<CODE> </CODE></P>

<H4>Store and Forward Networks</H4>

<P>The concept was well known by the 1960s. Telegraphy systems: telegrams
forwarded from one site to the next in the network, where messages were
transcribed and retransmitted to the next site down the line in the direction
of the final destination. This does not fully capture the nature of a packet
switching network however.</P>

<H5>Baran and Davies</H5>

<P><B>early 1960s:</B> Paul Baran, working at RAND Corporation, postulated
many of the key concepts of packet switching networks that were ultimately
to be implemented in the ARPANet. Motivation was to use radically new approaches
to build survivable communications systems. An engineer working for the
British government, Donald Davies, had similar ideas around the same time,
and is credited with coining the term &quot;packet&quot;.</P>

<P>Telephone system is centralized switching architecture; rigid concept
of connection or &quot;circuit&quot; that must be established between the
parties of a communications. If a pathway or switch is broken (or destroyed)
during a connection, the path will be broken and the communications will
fail. Unacceptable in a survivable system. Replace centralized switches
with large numbers of distributed routers, each with multiple connections
to adjacent routers. Messages would be divided into parts (<EM>blocks</EM>
or <EM>packets</EM>), routed independently, on a packet by packet basis.
Some advantages when dealing with unpredictable traffic demands.</P>

<P>Dynamic packet-at-a-time routing, which Baran called &quot;hot potato
routing,&quot; allows traffic to be statistically multiplexed over available
communications paths, gracefully adapting to the traffic demands and better
utilizing existing link capacity without the need for preallocated link
bandwidth. Local information used to choose the next hop on the routing
path; no centralized point of control in the system. This is the essence
of a packet switching network.</P>

<H4>Development of the ARPANet</H4>

<P><STRONG>Middle 1960s</STRONG>: First efforts to interconnect geographically
distributed computers. Tom Marill, Computer Corporation of America, coined
term &quot;protocol&quot; to describe the rules of exchange of data between
machines. Under ARPA sponsorship, his team and additional engineers at MIT's
Lincoln Labs experimented with the first cross country interconnection of
computer via telephone modems.</P>

<P><STRONG>1967</STRONG>: ARPA proposed ambitious program to connect many
host computers at key research sites across the country, using point-to-point
telephone lines. Wes Clark proposed idea of using separate switching computers,
rather than the hosts, to serve as the routing elements of network, thereby
offloading this function from the timesharing hosts. Bolt Beranek and Newman
got contract to build the interface message processors (IMPS). Frank Heart,
Bob Kahn, David Waldin, Willy Crowther, and other engineers at BBN develop
necessary Host-to-IMP and IMP-to-IMP protocols, the original flow control
algorithms, and the congestion control algorithms. The ARPANet is born with
it first four nodes at UCLA, UCSB, SRI, Utah.</P>

<P><STRONG>1969</STRONG>: UCLA becomes first node of the ARPAnet. Second
IMP placed at SRI a few months later. The IMP was later followed by the
TIP, or Terminal IMP, to allow dial-up access to the ARPANet without the
need for a host computer login<CODE>.</CODE></P>

<H4>The Aloha Net</H4>

<P><STRONG>1969</STRONG>: Norm Abramson launched Aloha Project at University
of Hawaii. Motivated by the poor telephone lines in the Hawaiian Islands,
funded by ARPA to investigate how to build a packet switched network based
on fixed site radio links. They developed significant new technology for
contention-based media access protocols, the so-called &quot;Aloha Protocols,&quot;
and applied these techniques to satellites as well as radio systems. Their
work was built upon by Robert Metcalfe at Xerox PARC, leading to the development
of the Ethernet protocols.</P>

<H4>The Need for Internetworking</H4>

<P><STRONG>1972</STRONG>: Kahn left BBN for ARPA. Roberts and Kahn launch
ARPA Packet Radio Program: packet switching techniques on the mobile battlefield.
ARPA also created a packet-switched experimental satellite network (SATNet),
with work done by Comsat, Linkabit, and BBN. Motivates need for technology
to link these independent networks together in a true &quot;network of networks.&quot;</P>

<P><STRONG>1973</STRONG>: Kahn and Vint Cerf (Professor at Stanford), developed
concept of a network gateway as well as the initial specifications for the
Transmission Control Protocol (TCP). Breakthrough concept: shift transmission
reliability from network to end hosts, thus allowing protocol to operate
no matter how unreliable the underlying links. &quot;End-to-end&quot; argument:
the underlying network is only as strong as its weakest link; improving
reliability of a single link or even an entire subnetwork has little effect
on end-to-end reliability. The best place to implement these functions are
at the ends of connection, not in the network.</P>

<P><STRONG>mid 1970s</STRONG>: ARPA began to transition the network. Operational
responsibility transferred to Defense Communications Agency. Cerf joined
ARPA to complete design of Internet Protocol Suite, oversee separation of
the routing portions of the protocols (IP) from the transport layer issues
(TCP), and transition the new protocols into the ARPANet. Switch over took
place in 1983.</P>

<P><STRONG>late 1970s</STRONG>: Berkeley UNIX played important role in moving
the TCP/IP implementation onto a platform independent operating system and
away from the BBN proprietary IMPs. This formed the model for later engineering
workstation and personal computer support for TCP/IP.</P>

<P><STRONG>early 1980s</STRONG>: ARPAnet technology began to move beyond
the limited number of members of the ARPA research community. The CSNet
project eventually led to the NSFNet under National Science Foundation sponsorship,
dramatically increasing the number of nodes on the network.<CODE> </CODE></P>

<P><STRONG>early 1990s</STRONG>: NSF privatized the network, leading to
the explosion in Internet service providers we see today.</P>
