<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>&quot;The good effects wrought by founders of cities, law givers, fathers
  of the peoples, extirpators of tyrants, and heros of that class, extend
  but for short times; whereas the work of the Inventor, though a thing of
  less pomp and show, is felt everywhere and lasts forever.&quot; Francis
  Bacon, 16th Century</P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H4><A HREF="electricity.html">A Quick Tutorial on Electricity</A></H4>

<H4>Earliest History</H4>

<P><EM>Electron</EM>: Greek word for amber (petrified tree sap).</P>

<P><STRONG>1500 AD</STRONG>: word is used to create words like &quot;electric&quot;
and &quot;electrify.&quot; When amber is rubbed, it exhibits an attractive
force -- static electricity. Electricity is built up and then discharged
by a spark. Other example of attractive forces: glass.</P>

<P><EM>Electricity</EM>: the &quot;fluid&quot; responsible for this attractive
force. Could be seen in sparks.</P>

<P><EM>Magnetism</EM>: known in ancient China. Lodestone -- natural magnet,
used as a compass to assist navigation.</P>

<P>Critical inventions needed to enable the electric telegraph: insulated
wires, batteries, and fundamental knowledge about electromagnetism such
as the ability of an electrical current to cause a needle to deflect, electromagnets,
etc.</P>

<H4>The Early &quot;Philosophers&quot; of Electricity</H4>

<H5>Alessandro Volta (1745 - 1827)</H5>

<P><STRONG>1779</STRONG>: Chair of Physics at Padua University</P>

<P><EM>Volt</EM>: the unit of electrical potential (&quot;electromotive
force&quot;).</P>

<P>Discovered that metals are &quot;movers&quot; of electricity. Arrange
metals in an electromotive series based on their ability to gain or lose
positive charges by contact.</P>

<P>Allowed steady flow of electricity instead of amber's electro-static
build-up. An early example of &quot;infrastructure&quot; that made it possible
for many others to experiment with electrical phenomena.</P>

<P>Voltaic pile: dissimilar metals separated by membranes moistened by acid
-- the electric battery.</P>

<H5>Andre-Marie Ampere (1775 - 1836)</H5>

<P><STRONG>1804</STRONG>: Professorship at the Ecole Polytechnique in Paris</P>

<P>Amp: the unit of electrical current (&quot;velocity of electrical flow&quot;)</P>

<P>Demonstrated the magnetic effects between two current carrying wires
are the same as those between a wire and magnet.</P>

<P>Electrodynamics: mechanical forces between current-carrying conductors
-- critical for the design of telegraph apparatus, telephone receivers,
and loud speakers.</P>

<H5>Georg Simon Ohm (1789 - 1854)</H5>

<P>Ohm: the unit of electrical resistance</P>

<P><STRONG>1817</STRONG>: Readership at the University of Cologne</P>

<P>I = V/R : the fundamental relationship between voltage (aka electromotive
force), current, and resistance (&quot;Ohm's Law&quot;)</P>

<H5>Hans Christian Oersted (1777 - 1851)</H5>

<P>Philosophical view that all of the forces of nature, i.e., light, electricity,
magnetism, gravity, are variations on one basic source. Discovered that
magnetic field exist around a current carrying conductor. A deflecting force,
such as magnetism, was something completely new (attracting forces like
gravity were already well known). Strong connection between electricity
and magnetism. Demonstrated this effect with the deflection of a magnetic
compass needle.</P>

<P><STRONG>1806</STRONG>: Professor of Physics at the University of Copenhagen</P>

<P><STRONG>1820</STRONG>: Chance observation of needle deflection during
a class lecture!</P>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="telegraph.frame.anc.gif" WIDTH="119" HEIGHT="161"
NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" ALIGN="BOTTOM"></P>

<P>Would have a profound impact on inventors attempting to build an early
electric telegraph.</P>

<H5>Michael Faraday (1791 - 1867)</H5>

<P>Farad: the electrical unit of capacitance (stored electrical charge).</P>

<P>Built on Oersted's observation of the deflecting needle. Demonstrated
the electric motor: wire carrying a current rotated around a fixed electromagnet.
Magnet stuck upright in mercury, current carrying wire suspended above magnet
with one end in mercury. Wire rotates around the magnet. Also showed how
to make a magnet rotate around a wire.</P>

<P>On his discovery of the principle of electromagnetic induction:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>Politician: &quot;But what's the use of it, Mr. Faraday?&quot;</P>
  <P>Michael Faraday: &quot;Ah, but what use is a baby?&quot;</P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>Induction:</P>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="telegraph.frame.anc1.gif" WIDTH="336" HEIGHT=
"125" NATURALSIZEFLAG="0" ALIGN="BOTTOM"></P>

<P>The fundamental law of electromagnetism:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>Whenever a closed conductor moves near a magnet in such a manner as
  to cut across magnetic lines, an electric current flows in the conductor.</P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>Two groups of electromagnetic phenomena:</P>

<UL>
  <LI>Varying current in one coil produces transient current in another coil
  -- <EM>electric induction</EM>.
  <LI>Relative motion between a magnet and a conductor -- <EM>magneto-electric
  induction</EM>.
</UL>

<H4>The Development of the Electric Telegraph</H4>

<P>Built on work of Volta, Faraday, Oersted. Signaling by means of electrical
current along a conducting wire.</P>

<P>Basic idea: deflect a needle by connecting/disconnecting a battery to
a wire. By alternating the connection between the + and - poles of the battery,
the deflection could be enhanced: needle reverses its swing.</P>

<P>Russian Baron Schilling, late <STRONG>1820s</STRONG>: deflecting disk,
one side white one side black, swings from edge on. Single show of black
edge = E, single show of white = T, Black followed by White = A, Two Blacks
= I, Two Whites = S, White followed by Black = N, and so on. Remarkably
like Morse's code!</P>

<H5><A HREF="../gifs/wheatstone.gif"><IMG SRC="../gifs/wheatstone.gif" 
WIDTH="109" HEIGHT="84" ALIGN="LEFT" NATURALSIZEFLAG="0"></A>Charles Wheatstone
(1802 - 1875) and William Fothergill Cooke (1806 - 1879)</H5>

<P>Wheatstone was Professor at King's College London. Cooke was seized with
the idea of making a commercially practical telegraph system based on the
needle galvanometer. Joined forces in 1837.</P>

<P>Their system: 5 magnetic needles, deflected in pairs, selecting one of
20 letters of the alphabet. Original system required 5 wires. Later reduced
to 2 by using coding techniques. 20 km of line installed along railway routes
in 1838. Grows to 4000 miles by 1852.</P>

<H5><A HREF="../gifs/morse.gif"><IMG SRC="../gifs/morse.gif" WIDTH="73"
HEIGHT="115" ALIGN="LEFT" NATURALSIZEFLAG="0"></A>Samuel F. B. Morse (1791
- 1872)</H5>

<P>Well known portrait painter, electricity was his hobby!</P>

<P><STRONG>1835</STRONG>: &quot;printing telegraph&quot; -- key switches
on current to electromagnet. Pencil makes a mark as long as key is held
down, drawing a long or short line on a moving strip of paper.</P>

<P><STRONG>1837</STRONG>: Morse code -- different combinations of dots and
dashes encode the letters of the alphabet and the numerials.</P>

<P>Binary code would have far reaching effects on future communications
systems. Basic needs for a telegraph system: key, battery, line, and sounder.</P>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><A HREF="morse0.html"><IMG SRC="../gifs/telethumb.gif" 
WIDTH="87" HEIGHT="120" ALIGN="BOTTOM" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></A></P>

<P><STRONG>1838</STRONG>: First pratical demonstration of his system, spanning
two miles (Morristown, NJ)</P>

<P>Morse has difficulty developing his invention. Goes to Congress for a
subsidy.</P>

<P><A HREF="morse1.html"><IMG SRC="../gifs/keythumb.gif" WIDTH="99" HEIGHT=
"73" NATURALSIZEFLAG="0" ALIGN="LEFT"></A><A HREF="morse2.html"><IMG SRC=
"../gifs/key1thumb.gif" WIDTH="104" HEIGHT="77" NATURALSIZEFLAG="0" ALIGN=
"RIGHT"></A><STRONG>1844</STRONG>: government-funded testbed links Baltimore
and Washington (37 miles). Sends the famous message: &quot;What hath God
wrought?&quot; Morse wanted to establish a government-owned telegraphy system
in the United States. Congress refused, and suggested that he develop the
system with the financial banking of the private sector. Sharp contrast
to the rest of the world, where the telegraphy system was absorbed into
postal systems administered by national governments.</P>

<H5>Telegraphy Spans the Globe</H5>

<P>The International Telegraphy Union developed from the need to transmit
telegrams across national boundaries.</P>

<P><STRONG>1852</STRONG>: First transnational telegram. Telegram originated
in Paris reached the French border with the German Principality of Baden.
Translated from French into German, rowed across the Rhine, and retransmitted
along Baden's telegraphic lines!</P>

<P>The world's first permanent international organization: the International
Bureau of Telegraph Administrations, founded in Berne Switzerland in the
late 1860s. Regulated international telegraphy rates, and established the
framework in which telegraphy systems could be joined across national boundaries.</P>

<P>European governments, rather than private enterprise, control the telegraph
lines. This had some serious political implications: it was not desirable
for diplomatic telegrams to be sent from London to St. Petersburg via Germany's
state controlled telegraph network at this time. Deployment of telegraphic
lines around the world driven by the need of the European powers to communicate
with their colonies.</P>

<P>New technologies needed to be developed to bridge water. Lieutenant in
the Prussian Artillery named <EM>Siemens</EM> invented a machine to coat
telegraphy cables with latex rubber, and he was the first to deploy telegraph
cables across the Rhine.</P>

<P><A HREF="cable.html"><IMG SRC="../gifs/cablethumb.gif" WIDTH="91" HEIGHT=
"120" ALIGN="LEFT" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></A>Transoceanic telegraph cables
very high risk venture in the middle of the 19th Century.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><STRONG>1858</STRONG>: Cyrus Field lays first transatlantic cable. President
Buchanan and Queen Victoria exchanged the first transatlantic telegrams
(August 14). Line failed within a few months: overzealous operator injects
too much current, causes insulation to break down.</P>

<P>Long cables act like a distributed capacitance, damping out electrical
impulses as they travel along the cable. Professor William Thompson, later
Lord Kelvin, analyzed the problem and developed very sensitive detection
equipment (mirror galvanometer).</P>

<P><STRONG>1866</STRONG>: New transatlantic cable was laid (using the world's
largest ship at the time, the <EM>Great Eastern</EM>), and this one operated
continuously. Heart's Content, Newfoundland to Valentia, Ireland.</P>

<P>Rapidly expanding telegraphic network that reached every corner of the
globe. By 1870, Great Britain communicates directly with North America,
Europe, the Middle East, and India, through the &quot;pink bits&quot; of
the map of the world.</P>

<P><STRONG>1850s</STRONG>: Reuthers sets up the &quot;Telegraph News Network&quot;
in London exploiting Great Britain's telegraph dominance.</P>

<P><STRONG>1861</STRONG>: Between July 4 and October 24, Western Union constructs
a telegraph line from St. Joseph, MO to Sacramento, CA. Puts the Pony Express
out of business. Operated until 1869, when replaced by multiwire system
that follows the transcontinental railway.</P>

<P>Other nations scrambled to duplicate Britain's global reach; no nation
could trust its critical command messages to the telegraphic lines of a
foreign power. E.g., during a crisis in French Indochina in 1893, dispatches
from Paris to its commanders in Southeast Asia held up by the British-owned
Eastern Telegraphic Company until they could be read by the British Cabinet!
So much for the statement that &quot;gentlemen do not read each others mail.&quot;</P>

<H5>William Thompson, Lord Kelvin (1824 - 1907)</H5>

<P><A HREF="../gifs/kelvin.gif"><IMG SRC="../gifs/kelvin.gif" WIDTH="146"
HEIGHT="93" NATURALSIZEFLAG="0" ALIGN="LEFT"></A>Professor at Glasgow University,
held the Chair of Natural Philosophy at age 22.</P>

<P>Fundamental contributions to thermodynamics (Kelvin is a unit a temperature
on the scale where absolute zero = 0).</P>

<P>Mirror galvanometer made possible reliable signaling across the Atlantic.</P>

<H5>Emile Baudot and Time Division Multiplexing</H5>

<P>Baud: unit of transmission bandwidth (&quot;a 9600 baud modem&quot;)</P>

<P><STRONG>1870s</STRONG>: Invented 5 unit code: any letter of the alphabet
encoded as a unique symbol in a 5-unit set. Operator has a keyboard with
5 keys, representing the 5-unit code for each letter of the alphabet.</P>

<P>Question: how large an alphabet can be captured by the 5-unit code?</P>

<P>Time division multiplexing: multiplex multiple messages in progress at
the same time over a single wire.</P>
