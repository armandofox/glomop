<H4>Making the Airwaves Sing . . .</H4>

<H5>John Ambrose Fleming (1849 - 1945)</H5>

<P><STRONG>1904</STRONG>: thermionic value--electrons in vacuum tube, with
heated cathode wire (source of electrons), flow in the singely in the direction
of the anode (positively changed to attract the electrons). Electrons flow
in only one direction, from cathode to anode. This makes it possible to
generate a direct current from an alternating current (aka &quot;rectifier&quot;).
Device is called a &quot;diode&quot; for its two inputs. Works for high
frequency waves as in radio -- could be used as a radio detector.</P>

<P>Professor at University College, London, and was an advisor to the Marconi
Company.</P>

<H5>Robert von Lieben (1878 - 1914)</H5>

<P><STRONG>1906</STRONG>: Adds third electrode to Fleming value--wire mesh
grid placed between electron-emitting cathode and positive potential anode.
Device is called a &quot;triode.&quot; Changing the voltage on the grid
modifies the current on the anode (changes the number of electrons flowing
to the anode). Acts just like a water or gas valve, except for electron
flow. Amplified signal emerges at the anode.</P>

<H5>Lee De Forest (1873 - 1961)</H5>

<P><A HREF="../gifs/deforest.jpg"><IMG SRC="../gifs/deforest.jpg" WIDTH=
"64" HEIGHT="85" NATURALSIZEFLAG="0" ALIGN="LEFT"></A><STRONG>1899</STRONG>:
PhD, Yale University. Series of jobs at Western Electric and American Wireless
Telegraph Company. Starts several companies that rise and fall in stock
speculation schemes.</P>

<P><STRONG>1900</STRONG>: Invents the responder, a acoustic device that
does away with Marconi's coherer and allows key operator to work with headphones
rather than telegraph inker.</P>

<P><STRONG>1906</STRONG>: Similar to Fleming and von Lieben. Thin-wire &quot;grid&quot;
between cathode and anode. Bent and zig-zigged to increase the surface area
of the grid. Device, called &quot;audion&quot; used for detection and amplification.
Real contribution was to combine triode with a resonant circuit to yield
an efficient way to generate a continuous high frequency signals. Leads
to the replacement of spark gap transmitters.</P>

<P><STRONG>1907</STRONG>: Early experiments in transmitting voice and music.</P>

<P><STRONG>1910</STRONG>: Radio Telephone--take sound waves impinging on
a microphone, modulate and amplify these onto a continuous high-frequency
oscillating signal (a &quot;carrier&quot; signal). Transmit these as a Hertzian
wave. Receive, amplify, rectify and transform back into sound via a loud
speaker.</P>

<P><STRONG>1910</STRONG>: First musical broadcast from the stage of the
Metropolitan Opera (Enrico Caruso in I Pagliacci).</P>

<P><STRONG>1916</STRONG>: Sets up own radio station.</P>

<H5>Reginald Fessenden</H5>

<P><STRONG>1904</STRONG>: Ernst Alexanderson, at GE, develops an ingenious
alternating current generator able to generate signals at 100,000 cycles
per second. High enough to use modulation to carry human voice. But device
is huge: large rotating disk spinning in a magnetic field at 20,000 revolutions
per minute.</P>

<P><STRONG>1906</STRONG>: Christmas Eve, Fessenden transmits voice, poetry,
music to ships in the Atlantic. Wireless becomes radio, telegraphy becomes
broadcasting.</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<H5>Edwin Armstrong</H5>

<P><A HREF="../gifs/armstrong2.jpg"><IMG SRC="../gifs/armstrong2.jpg" WIDTH=
"63" HEIGHT="80" NATURALSIZEFLAG="0" ALIGN="LEFT"></A><STRONG>1912</STRONG>:
Invents <EM>regeneration</EM>. Exploits feedback in the audion circuit to
dramatically improve reception sensitivity: feed oscillating current from
plate back to the grid. Much more sensitive reception becomes possible:
able to pick up dots and dashes from England or Hawaii on US east coast.
Leads to long legal squabble between Armstrong and De Forest over who invented
amplification. Finally resolved by the Supreme Court in 1928, in De Forest's
favor (despite the fact that De Forest could not explain why his device
provided amplification).</P>

<P><STRONG>1918</STRONG>: Armstrong a Captain in US Army Signal Corp. Invents
<EM>superheterodyne</EM> detection, opens up access to higher frequency
transmission and reception. Based on work of Fessenden: he had discovered
that two incoming radio signals of different frequencies could be mixed
to yield a thrid signal with frequency that is the difference of the other
two. He called this hetero - &quot;other&quot; - dyne - &quot;force.&quot;</P>

<P>Superheterodyne (SH): Principle is to mix a carrier frequency with a
local oscillation frequency to generate an lower frequency intermediate
waveform that is easier to process. Regeneration circuit used both as a
receiver and oscillator of radio waves.</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>1. SH receiver picks up high frequency, heterodynes it with another
  reference wave to obtain a wave of intermediate frequency (IF).</P>
  <P>2. IF travels thru amplifier to increase its power several thousand
  times.</P>
  <P>3. Regeneration circuit detects the wave and converts it to direct current.</P>
  <P>4. Current passes through audio amplifier to earphones or a speaker.</P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><STRONG>1921</STRONG>: <EM>Superregeneration</EM>. Howling sound when
regenerated signal is passed through amplifier more than 20,000 times in
one second. Suppresses the noise by developing a new quenching circuit to
limit the number of feedback cycles to less than 20,000. Yields very high
levels of amplification. But oscillator also acts like a transmitter, and
so interfers with near-by receivers. Never as commercially successful as
his other inventions.</P>

<P><STRONG>1933</STRONG>: <EM>frequency modulation</EM> (FM). Encode sounds
not by modulating the amplitude of a carrier waveform, but its frequency.
Goal was to eliminate static. Noise tends to distort signal amplitudes,
has much less effect on frequency distortions.</P>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="broadcast.frame.anc1.gif" WIDTH="414" HEIGHT=

<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="broadcast.frame.anc2.gif" WIDTH="277" HEIGHT=
"255" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" ALIGN="BOTTOM"></P>

<P>Theoretical analysis by AT&amp;T scientists indicated that FM would not
work. Turns out that the analysis, limited to narrow frequency band, was
not valid for wide-band transmission. When Armstrong developed his wide-band
FM system, it yielded much better fidelity in the received sound.</P>

<P>Required new receiver designs: (1) limiter circuit removes amplitude
changes in the received signal, (2) descriminator circuit translates frequency
changes back into amplitude changes.</P>

<P>Second advantage: circumvents the capture effect that affected AM transmissions.</P>

<P><STRONG>1935</STRONG>: 5 November--First public demonstration of FM broadcasting,
from experimental transmitter at the Empire State Building. Crumpling paper,
tearing paper, reverberations of a small Oriental gong being tapped lightly,
record of a Sousa march, etc. Audio fidelity of a level never heard before.
Testing stopped when RCA wanted access to the transmitter for experimental
television broadcasts.</P>

<P>World War II and machinations by RCA halt development of FM. FM widely
used in American communications systems developed during the war. Armstrong
gave up his patent rights for the war effort.</P>

<P><STRONG>1945</STRONG>: FM stations go into operation.</P>

<P><STRONG>Early 1950s</STRONG>: RCA develops an alternative form of FM
system that it claims circumvents Armstrong's patents. System actually did
not work very well. RCA ties up Armstrong in the courts. Armstrong sues
RCA, claiming that the company had conspired to discourage FM, had persuaded
the FCC to allocate it an inadequate number of suitable frequencies, and
had illegally obstructed Armstrong's patent applications.</P>

<P><STRONG>1953</STRONG>: Armstrong demonstrates radio multiplexing--the
ability to transmit multiple signals on the same FM waveform. This eventually
led to FM's ability to transmit stereo audio signals.</P>

his patent claims against RCA, jumps out of a window and kills himself.
Eventually his wife succeeds in winning the legal battles.</P>

David Sarnoff. Rose from ranks of Marconi messenger boys to become chairman
of RCA. Wrote far reaching proposal for &quot;radio music box:&quot;</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P><FONT SIZE=-1>&quot;... a radio telephone transmitter having a range
  of, say, 25 to 50 miles can be installed at a fixed point where the instrumental
  or voice music or both are produced. The problem of transmitting music
  has already been solved in principle, and therefore all the receivers attuned
  to the transmitting wavelength should be capable of receiving such music.
  The receiver can be designed in the form of a simple &quot;Radio Music
  Box&quot; and arranged for several different wavelengths, which should
  be changeable with the throwing of a single switch or pressing of a single
  button.&quot;</FONT></P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><STRONG>1919</STRONG>: RCA formed as a wholly US company from the British-owned
Marconi Company. Held patent on DeForest triode valve, Westinghouse patents
of Armstrong and Fessenden on heterodyne reception. Cross licenses patents
with AT&amp;T to centralize all intellectual property needed to commercialize
broadcast radio (RCA uses patents for one-way broadcast, AT&amp;T uses patents
for two-way telephony).</P>

<P><STRONG>1920</STRONG>: first radio station KDKA--Pittsburgh, PA. Broadcasts
at 100W with 360 m waves. Covers Harding-Cox presidential election. Few
radio receivers. 30 stations in operation by 1922 (100,000 radios sold),
556 in 1923 (500,000 radios sold).</P>

<P><STRONG>1921</STRONG>: RCA generates huge profits from its combined dominance
in radio broadcasting equipment and radio receivers. AT&amp;T attempts to
break the back of RCA by going into competition with them. AT&amp;T's radio
station begins &quot;toll broadcasting,&quot; also known as commercials!</P>

RCA spins off the National Broadcasting Corporation (NBC). AT&amp;T gets
out of the broadcasting business.</P>

<P><STRONG>1930</STRONG>: 40% of American homes have a radio. By 1938, 82%
of homes had one.</P>

<P><STRONG>Late 1930s</STRONG>: RCA stalls FM developments. Wanted to sell
AM sets and also focused on television development.</P>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>An ancient dream -- to be able to see beyond the horizon.</P>

<H5>Early Pioneers</H5>

<P><STRONG>1872</STRONG>: Joseph May, worker at England's Telegraph Construction
and Maintenance company, discovers by accident that the resistance of selenium
rods -- being used as part of the equipment for the Transatlantic telegraph
cable -- varies based on their exposure to light.</P>

<P>Visual telegraph a possibility -- light shining on a selenium cell could
transmit a burst of electricity. Construct a matrix of such cells, convert
current at receiving end back to light to reconstruct a picture. However
selenium is not a good material to use. After exposure to light, takes along
time before it is sensitive to light again. Won't work to send a rapid sequence
of pictures to portray motion.</P>

<P>Throughout last part of 19th Century, many proposals for &quot;electric
telescopes.&quot; For example, M. Senleq of Ardres France proposes a system
for &quot;tracing&quot; an object by moving a piece of selenium behind a
lens that focused the object; the current sent would control a pencil at
a distance that would draw the object focused through the lens!</P>

<P><STRONG>1880</STRONG>: Maurice LeBlanc proposes a key feature--a mechanism
by which a single &quot;photocell&quot; will trace the image in left-to-right,
top-to-bottom fashion, and then repeats the process. Suggested a vibrating
mirror scheme, but it never worked.</P>

<P><A HREF="../gifs/nipkow.jpg"><IMG SRC="../gifs/nipkow.jpg" WIDTH="63"
HEIGHT="73" NATURALSIZEFLAG="0" ALIGN="LEFT"></A><STRONG>1883</STRONG>:
Paul Nipkow--the first simple method for scanning using a mechanical disk.
Close spiral of holes from edge to center drilled into a rigid disk. As
disk spins rapidly, sequence of holes scans a brightly lit picture or scene.
In one rotation, first hole scans one line of image, second hole scans next,
and so on. Light falls on a photoelectric cell; indicates intensity of incident
light. Could trigger an array of light bulbs to turn on and off at the receiving
end.</P>

<P><STRONG>1900</STRONG>: First use of the word television, coined by Constantin
Perskyi at the International Electricity Congress associated with the 1900
Paris Exposition.</P>

<P><STRONG>1906</STRONG>: Max Dieckmann in Germany demonstrates the cathode
ray tube:</P>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="broadcast.frame.anc4.gif" WIDTH="440" HEIGHT=
"122" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" ALIGN="BOTTOM">.</P>

<P><STRONG>1908</STRONG>: A. A. Campbell Swinton suggestions the possibility
of an all electronic system based on cathode ray oscilloscope. Heated cathode
generates electrons, directed to phosphorous-coated tube surface via two
pairs of charged plates: one horizontal, one vertical. Uniformly increasing
voltage applied to vertical pair causes a vertical line to be drawn on the
tube. A small increase in voltage on the horizontal pair causes the next
line to be drawn above the previous. &quot;Progressive scan.&quot; Intensity
of point of light can be varied to correspond to bright or dim points of
light.</P>

<H5>John Logie Baird (died 1946)</H5>

<P><A HREF="../gifs/baird.jpg"><IMG SRC="../gifs/baird.jpg" WIDTH="58" 
HEIGHT="72" NATURALSIZEFLAG="0" ALIGN="LEFT"></A>A inventor and tinkerer
overpoweringly motivated by the desire to make a great fortune. Very limited
technical training or expertise.</P>

<P><STRONG>Early 1920s</STRONG>: Receives credit for developing the first
working television set: a contraption in which light fell on a cross, the
light and shadow of which fell on a rotating Nipkow disk, which impinged
on a selenium cell, which controlled another light that turned on and off,
which was then view through a second spinning disk synchronized with the
first. Fundamental quality limit is how many times per second can you rotate
the disk -- lines per image, images per second. 10 times per second is not
good enough. Such an electromechanical approach was finally surpassed by
an all electronic system some years later.</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P><FONT SIZE=-1>&quot;I attended a demonstration of Mr. Baird's apparatus
  and was very favourably impressed with the results. His machinery is, however,
  astonishingly crude and the apparatus in general is built out of derelict
  odds and ends. The optical system is composed of lenses out of bicycle
  lamps. The framework is an inimpressive erection of old sugar boxes and
  the electrical wiring a nightmare cobweb of improvisations. The outstanding
  miracle is that he has been able to produce any result at all with the
  indifferent material at his disposal.&quot; <EM>Editor of Discovery Magazine</EM>,

<P><STRONG>1925</STRONG>: Marries the Nipkow disk to radio transmission.
Builds an electromechanical system that transmits its signals by radio to
a receiving device. Demonstrates the system at Selfridge's department store
in London. Outlines and shapes could be seen, but little detail.</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P><FONT SIZE=-1>&quot;Selfridge's presents the first public demonstration
  of television in the Electrical Section (First Floor). Television is to
  light what telephony is to sound -- it means INSTANTANEOUS transmission
  of a picture, so that the observer at the receiving end can see, to all
  intents and purposes, what is cinematographic view of what is happening
  at the sending end. For many years experiments have been conducted with
  this end in view; the apparatus that is here being demonstrated, is the
  first to be successful.&quot;</FONT></P>

  <P><FONT SIZE=-1>&quot;All the way back to the studio Mr. Baird was busily
  extolling the virtues his mechanical system over Farnsworth's. As they
  came to the door, Mr. Baird, still in argument, caught sight of the picture
  on the monitor and became silent. He advanced slowly, as if hypnotized,
  until he was standing directly before it. He stood there for a time; then
  breaking the spell with a visible effort, he turned without a word and
  left. With great empathy, Phil watched him go, aware Mr. Baird had seen
  the death knell of his beloved spinning disc.&quot; Pem Farnsworth</FONT></P>

<H5>C. Francis Jenkins</H5>

<P>A professional inventor and promoter. In 1895, he invented the first
practical motion picture projector: the &quot;Projecting Phantoscope.&quot;
In 1920, he improved the projector by replacing the shutter mechanism, with
its abrupt open-close function, with a rotating prism that continuously
bent the light as the film moved past. This made high speed slow motion
possible. It also suggested an alternative scanning mechanism for television.</P>

<P><STRONG>1921</STRONG>: Jenkins Laboratories founded in Washington DC,
to &quot;develop radio movies to be broadcast for entertainment in the home.&quot;
October 1921 transmits pictures over telephone wires.</P>

<P><STRONG>1925</STRONG>: Demonstrates &quot;radio vision&quot;-- a 48 line
moving picture of a windmill transmitted via radio for Bureau of Standards
and the US Navy. Note that he had hooked up the system to a movie projector,
not a camera! Beat out by Baird, who two months earlier had demonstrated
his system in England. (Today's US TV standard is 525 lines per image).</P>

<P><STRONG>1927</STRONG>: Markets his radiovisor. Moving images with no
sound. Regular broadcasts begin on 2 July 1928. MWF at 8 PM. Jenkins Television
Corporation founded with initial stock offering of $10 million.</P>

<P><STRONG>1929</STRONG>: Broadcast station in Jersey City, NJ. 6 nights
a week from 8-9 PM.</P>

<P><STRONG>1931</STRONG>: Jenkins universal television receiver costs $82.95;
$42.50 for the build it yourself kit. 60 line pictures. 4 hours of broadcasting
per day, except Sunday.</P>

<H5>Corporations Move In on the Inventors</H5>

<P><STRONG>1925</STRONG>: Alexanderson of RCA and General Electric demonstrates
the principles for his television system. Horizontal bar of light passed
through a prism and projected onto a phtoelectrical cell. Current transmitted
by radio, where used to control mirror of a standard oscillograph. Lenses
and arc produce a light beam passed through a crystal and focused on a screen.
<STRONG>January 1927</STRONG>: Alexanderson successfully demonstrates transmission
of film strip via wireless. Moving pictures, but still using mechanical
devices for scanning and displaying. Capture devices is based on a rotating
mirror drum rather than Nipkow disk. As drum rotates, mirror reflects additional
points onto photocell.</P>

<P><STRONG>1921</STRONG>: 14 year old Farnsworth has vision of how to build
television system from horizontal beams. Inspiration comes from viewing
the perfect rows of his mowed hay field.</P>

<P><STRONG>1922</STRONG>: Develops concept for TV camera tube similar to
Zworykin's. Electron beam does not scan image, rather image is magnetically
focused onto an anode aperature. Light areas generate current, allowing
an electrical picture to be formed.</P>
