<H2>Charles Dickens' LITTLE DORRIT</H2>

<H3>Daniel Doyce's Case</H3>

<P>'I undoubtedly was made to feel,' said the inventor [Daniel Doyce], 'as
if I had committed an offence. In dancing attendance at the various offices,
I was always treated, more or less, as if it was a very bad offence. I have
frequently found it necessary to reflect, for my own self-support, that
I really had not done anything to bring myself into the Newgate Calendar,
but only wanted to effect a great saving and a great improvement.'<BR>
<BR>
With this prelude, Mr. Meagles went through the narrative the established
narrative, which has become tiresome, the matter-of-course narrative which
we all know by heart. How after interminable attendance and correspondence,
after infinite impertinences, ignorances, and insults, my lords made a Minute,
number three thousand four hundred and seventy-two, allowing the culprit
to make certain trials of his invention at his own expense. How the trials
were made in the presence of a board of six, of whom two ancient members
were too blind to see it, two other ancient members were too deaf to hear
it, one other an cient member was too lame to get near it, and the final
ancient member was too pigheaded to look at it. How there were more years;
more impertinences, ignorances, and insults. How my lords then made a Minute,
number five thousand one hundred and three, whereby they resigned the business
to the Circumlocution Office. How the Circumlocution Office, in course of
time, took up the business as if it were a bran new thing of yesterday,
which had never been heard of before; muddled the business, addled the business,
tossed the business in a wet blanket. How the impertinences, ignorances,
and insults went through the multiplication table. How there was a reference
of the invention to three Barnacles and a Stiltstalking, who knew nothing
about it; into whose heads nothing could be hammered about it; who got bored
about it, and reported physical impossibilities about it. How the Circumlocution
Office, in a Minute, number eight thousand seven hundred and forty,'saw
no reason to reverse the decision at which my lords had arrived.' How the
Circumlocution Office, being reminded that my lords had arrived at no decision,
shelved the business. How there had been a final interview with the head
of the Circumlocution Office that very morning, and how the Brazen Head
had spoken, and had been, upon the whole, and under all the circumstances,
and looking at it from the various points of view, of opinion that one of
two courses was to be pursued in respect of the business: that was to say,
either to leave it alone for evermore, or to begin it all over again.<BR>
<BR>
'Upon which,' said Mr. Meagles, 'as a practical man, I then and there, in
that presence, took Doyce by the collar, and told him it was plain to me
that he was an infamous rascal, and treasonable disturber of the government
peace, and took him away. I brought him out of the office door by the collar,
that the very porter might know I was a practical man who appreciated the
official estimate of such characters; and here we are!'<BR>
<BR>
If that airy young Barnacle had been there, he would have frankly told them
perhaps that the Circumlocution Office had achieved its functions. That
what the Barnacles had to do, was to stick on to the national ship as long
as they could. That to trim the ship, lighten the ship, clean the ship,
would be to knock them off; that they could but be knocked off once; and
that if the ship went down with them yet sticking to it, that was the ship's
look out, and not theirs.<BR>
<BR>
'There!' said Mr. Meagles, 'now you know all about Doyce. Except, which
I own does not improve my state of mind, that even now you don't hear him
complain.'<BR>
<BR>
'You must have great patience,' said Arthur Clennam, looking at him with
some wonder, 'great forbearance.'<BR>
<BR>
'No,' he returned, 'I don't know that I have more than another man.'<BR>
<BR>
'By the Lord, you have more than I have though!' cried Mr. Meagles.<BR>
<BR>
Doyce smiled, as he said to Clennam, 'You see, my experience of these things
does not begin with myself. It has been in my way to know a little about
them, from time to time. Mine is not a particular case. I am not worse used
than a hundred others, who have put themselves in the same position--than
all the others, I was going to say.'<BR>
