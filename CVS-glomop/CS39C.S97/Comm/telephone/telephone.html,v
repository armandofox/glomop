<H4>The Telegraph Learns to Talk</H4>

<P><STRONG>10 March 1876</STRONG>: first demonstration of electronic transmission
of speech by Alexander Graham Bell.</P>

<P>Bell was born in Edinburgh Scotland in 1847. Family moves to Canada and
later Boston. Becomes Professor of Vocal Physiology at Boston University:
teacher of deaf children, disproving commonly held theory that the deaf
could not be taught to speak.</P>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><A HREF="../gifs/telediagram.gif"><IMG SRC="../gifs/telediagram.gif"
WIDTH="171" HEIGHT="72" NATURALSIZEFLAG="0" ALIGN="BOTTOM"></A></P>

<P>The Basic Invention: magnetic induction method. Thin iron diaphragm in
front of an iron core surrounded by a coil of wire. Sound waves hitting
the core cause it to vibrate in the magnetic field, inducing an electric
current in the surrounding wire coil. This is transmitted by wires to the
receiver, where the current variations induce a magnetic field, move the
receiver's core, and cause the diaphragm to vibrate.</P>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><A HREF="telephone0.html"><IMG SRC="../gifs/bellthumb.gif"
WIDTH="160" HEIGHT="120" ALIGN="BOTTOM" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></A></P>

<P>Bell's first patent, #174,465, of March 1876. Original magnetic induction
method replaced by variable resistance circuits. Changes in resistance induce
changes in current and vice versa.</P>

<P>Exhibited at the US Centenary Celebration at Philadelphia, July 1876.
Operating in only one direction and over only a few hundred feet of twisted
pair wires!</P>

<P>Thomas Edison's improvement: carbon granule transmitter. Better sensitivity
than Bell's. Aluminum alloy diaphragm, sealed section with a sandwich of
front carbon, carbon granuales, and back carbon.</P>

<P><STRONG>1877</STRONG>: Bell offers to sell out to the Western Union company
for $100,000. They refuse. Bell Telephone company founded 9 July 1877.</P>

<P><STRONG>1878</STRONG>: Western Union enters competition with Bell, using
equipment designed by Thomas Edison and Elisha Gray. Bell sues Western Union
for patent infringement and wins in 1879. Western Union leaves the telephone
business.</P>

<H4>Evolution of the Network</H4>

<P>Bell's patents expire in early 1890s. Virtually anyone can build telephone
handsets. 6000 independent telephone companies spring up. Challenge is to
interconnect them.</P>

<P>American Telephone and Telegraph (AT&amp;T) formed to provide long distance
service. Becomes parent company of the Bell System in 1900.</P>

<P>Switches: start out as peg boards manually establishing connections by
telephone operators. Are eventually replaced by mechanical systems.</P>

Almon Brown Strowger (1839 - 1902). Invents the &quot;girl-less, cuss-less&quot;
telephone system. His invention consists of:</P>

<UL>
  <P>&nbsp;
  <LI>A device for use by customer, creates trains of on-off current pulses
  corresponding to the digits 0-9 (this evolves into the rotary telephone
  dial)
  <LI>Switch at telephone exchange. Rotating arm steps over, in a semi-circular
  fashion, 10 possible contact points. Stepping motion controlled by current
  pulses coming from the originating customer's dialing device.
  <LI>These can be cascaded to enable connection among more than 10 customers.
  <LI>Switching device can also be positioned in vertical direction as well
  as horizontal direction, also increasing the switching capacity.
</UL>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><A HREF="../gifs/teleswitch.jpg"><IMG SRC="../gifs/telethumb.jpg"
WIDTH="104" HEIGHT="95" ALIGN="BOTTOM" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></A></P>

<P>Not widely deployed by the Bell System until the 1920s. Switches grow
to capacity of 100,000 connections.</P>

<P>Early days of telephony were really a construction business: iron wires,
copper wires, twisted pair to carry ground signal, wooden poles, and subterranean
cables.</P>

<P>Characterized by many independent operators. Subscribers to different
service providers could not call each other even if in they were in the
same town. No rules of interconnection existed, long distance &quot;toll&quot;
calls were very rare, and the result was chaos.</P>

<P><STRONG>1913</STRONG>: AT&amp;T and the U. S. government reached the
famous Kingsbury Agreement; AT&amp;T becoming synonomous with a national
telephone network in return for regulated monopoly status and the promise
to deliver &quot;universal&quot; telephone service. In 1910, Bell System
owns 50% of the telephone access market. Competing companies exist in some
large Urban areas well into 1920s/30s. Long distance interconnection withheld
as a competitive weapon. By 1950, Bell System owns 84% of the local telephone
access market.</P>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><A HREF="telephone2.html"><IMG SRC="../gifs/teleph1thumb.gif"
WIDTH="78" HEIGHT="119" ALIGN="BOTTOM" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></A></P>

<P><STRONG>1950s</STRONG>: Two thirds of all residential lines in US still
party lines. Unified network signaling first exposed to subscribers, allowing
them to make direct distance dialing (DDD) long distance telephone calls.</P>

<P><STRONG>1950s-1970s</STRONG>: Rapid extension of the long-distance phone
network made possible by the rise of digital, more highly automated techniques.</P>

<P><STRONG>1980s</STRONG>: Deregulation</P>

<P><STRONG>1990s</STRONG>: New access technologies--fiber and wireless.</P>

<H4>Increasing Wire Capacity: Frequency and Time Division</H4>

<P>Wires and cables, especially between cities, were expensive; many of
the early innovations were directed towards carrying multiple conversations
on the same set of wires</P>

<H5>Frequency Division Multiplexing</H5>

<P>Multiple telephone or telegraph signals transmitted over same wire. Each
sent on carrier wave of differing frequency. Receiving end uses &quot;wave
filter&quot; tuned to carrier frequency to extract the original signals.</P>

<P><STRONG>1875/1876</STRONG>: Alexander Graham Bell uses tuned vibrating
reeds to demonstrate the concept for multiple simultaneous transmission
of telegraph messages using mechanical rather then electronic resonance.</P>

<P><STRONG>1890s</STRONG>: Michael Pupin, Columbia University, developed
tuned resonating electronic circuits. Used for multichannel telephony circuits.</P>

<P>Basic elements of the system:</P>

<UL>
  <LI><EM>carrier wave</EM>: source of stable continuous high frequency electromagnetic
  oscillations
  <LI><EM>modulation</EM>: a means for varying the amplitude of the carrier
  wave in sympathy with the amplitude of a voice wave or telepgraph signal
  <LI><EM>wave filter</EM>: capable of selecting the modulated carrier wave
  from others of different frequency
  <LI><EM>demodulation</EM>: extracting the desired voice or telegraph signal
  from the modulated carrier wave
</UL>

<P>Required the invention of the triode/audion value in the 1900s before
it could really become widely used.</P>

<H5>Time Division Multiplexing</H5>

<P><STRONG>1853</STRONG>: Duplex circuit allowing a telegraph message to
be received while one was also being sent.</P>

<P><STRONG>1874</STRONG>: Thomas Edison develops duplex and quadraplex circuits--up
to four messages on a single wire</P>

<P><STRONG>1874</STRONG>: French Telegrapher Emile Baudot invents time division
multiplexing</P>

<UL>
  <P>&nbsp;
  <LI>Telegraph key replaced with 5-key keyboard. Alphabet encodes 32 different
  symbols, enough for every letter in the alphabet.
  <LI>Rotating commutators synchronized at both ends of the line. Symbols
  are buffered in series at each keyboard. Select next symbol for transmission
  from one keyboard to the next, intermixing the outputs from each key station.
  Reassembled (&quot;demultiplexed&quot;) at the receiving end, one symbol
  from each keyboard.

"3">Mobile Telephony</H4>

<P>Soon after his electrical telephone, Bell invented a &quot;photophone&quot;
that allowed wireless communications using reflected light beams.</P>

<P><STRONG>1920s</STRONG>: Technological developments coming together to
make mobile communications possible. Driven by military and police applications,
design challenges imposed by the size and power constraints of mobile transmitters,
and the rise of frequency modulation (FM).</P>

<P><STRONG>1921</STRONG>: Detroit first to experiment with police car dispatch
via radio. Initially the system operated in one way only, with transmission
from a centralized transmitter to the police cars. Transmission from vehicles
was difficult: need to make transmitters small enough with small enough
power demands to be transportable.</P>

<P><STRONG>1930s</STRONG>: development of 2-way police radio systems. First
deployed in Bayonne, N.J. Half-duplex (&quot;push to talk&quot;) communications
to compensate for high power transmitter in close proximity to highly sensitive
receiver in the vehicle.</P>

<P><STRONG>1934</STRONG>: Federal Communications Commission founded. First
crisis: allocating sufficient bandwidth for law enforcement users.</P>

<P><STRONG>1935</STRONG>: Armstrong invented frequency modulation. Virtually
eliminated background static and required much less transmission power,
thus enabling lower powered vehicular transmitters and receivers. FM also
has ability to &quot;capture&quot; or lock on to the stronger signal in
the same band, and is more tolerant of mobile propagation problems like
fast fading.</P>

<P><STRONG>World War II</STRONG>: rapid development of mobile radio technology.
The need for hundred of thousands of portable communicators accelerated
advances in system packaging, reliability improvements, and cost reductions.
The war played a critical role in stimulating the development of a commercial
FM manufacturing ability.</P>

<P><STRONG>1946</STRONG>: AT&amp;T received first mobile telephone license,
for St. Louis. The initial car phone systems depended upon a single centralized
transmitter to cover a whole metropolitan area. The original technology
encoded the 3 kHz human voice signal in 120 KHz of wireless spectrum. The
Improved Mobile Telephone Service (IMTS) provided full duplex, increasingly
narrow band FM, with full interoperation with the wireline telephone system.
Spectrum utilization was eventually improved by a factor of four, to 30
KHz, by the 1970s. However, the result was far from able to keep up with
demand. Even in 1976, the New York area could support only 543 users, with
3700 users on the wait list.</P>

<P>Bell Labs engineers refining the design of the cellular telephone system.
Many small transmitters, spread out to cover a geographical service area.
System capacity improved by reusing the allocated spectrum on a cell by
cell basis. However, this adds the extra implementation complexity of hand
off.</P>

<P>Competition with broadcast applications for access to spectrum.</P>

<P><STRONG>1947</STRONG>: AT&amp;T proposed to the FCC the establishment
of 40 MHz of spectrum for urban mobile telephony anywhere between 100 MHz
and 450 MHz. Unfortunately, no unused spectrum was available.</P>

<P><STRONG>1949</STRONG>, FCC considers how to allocate the UHF spectrum
from 470 - 890 MHz. AT&amp;T proposed an allocation for mobile telephony,
but the FCC decided in favor of UHF TV.</P>

<P><STRONG>1958</STRONG>: AT&amp;T proposed 75 MHz for mobile telephony
in the 800 MHz region; FCC does not act.</P>

<P><STRONG>1968</STRONG>: FCC considering the reallocation of UHF channels
70-84 to mobile telephony. AT&amp;T proposed the cellular system. A number
of presentations over a three year period, formal filing by AT&amp;T in
December 1971.</P>

<P>Further deliberations by the FCC over the next twelve years did. At one
point, allocations of 115 MHz (75 MHz for telephony and 40 MHz for &quot;dispatch
radio&quot;) are considered, but there were no allocations made until 1983.</P>

<P>During this time, FCC allowed two experimental systems to be established,
one by Motorola in DC area and one by AT&amp;T in Chicago. The Motorola
experimental system remained relatively small, but the Chicago experimental
system grew to cover the metro area and to serve many thousands of users.</P>

<P><STRONG>1983</STRONG>: FCC finally allocated the spectrum. AT&amp;T system
in Chicago became first commercial cellular system in the U.S.</P>
