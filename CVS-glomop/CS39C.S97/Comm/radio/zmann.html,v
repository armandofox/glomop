<H2 ALIGN=CENTER>The Zimmermann Telegram</H2>

<H4><I><BR>
</I>January 16, 1917</H4>

<P>Zimmermann's (the German Foreign Minister) instruction to Bernstorff
(the German Ambassador in Washington), numbered 158: &quot;Most secret.
For Your Excellency's personal information and to be handed on to the Imperial
Minister in Mexico by a safe route.&quot; Following this came the message
to Eckhardt (German Consul in Mexico City). It was headed &quot;No. 1''
and the full text read:</P>

<P>WE INTEND TO BEGIN UNRESTRICTED SUBMARINE WARFARE ON THE FIRST OF FEBRUARY.
WE SHALL ENDEAVOR IN SPITE OF THIS TO KEEP THE UNITED STATES NEUTRAL. IN
THE EVENT OF THIS NOT SUCCEEDING, WE MAKE MEXICO A PROPOSAL OF ALLIANCE
ON THE FOLLOWING BASIS: MAKE WAR TOGETHER, MAKE PEACE TOGETHER, GENEROUS
FINANCIAL SUPPORT, AND AN UNDERSTANDING ON OUR PART THAT MEXICO IS TO RECONQUER
THE LOST TERRITORY IN TEXAS, NEW MEXICO, AND ARIZONA. THE SETTLEMENT IN
DETAIL IS LEFT TO YOU.</P>

<P>YOU WILL INFORM THE PRESIDENT [OF MEXICO] OF THE ABOVE MOST SECRETLY
AS SOON AS THE OUTBREAK OF WAR WITH THE UNITED STATES IS CERTAIN AND ADD
THE SUGGESTION THAT HE SHOULD, ON HIS OWN INITIATIVE, INVITE JAPAN TO IMMEDIATE
ADHERENCE AND AT THE SAME TIME MEDIATE BETWEEN JAPAN AND OURSELVES.</P>

<P>PLEASE CALL THE PRESIDENT'S ATTENTION TO THE FACT THAT THE UNRESTRICTED
EMPLOYMENT OF OUR SUBMARINES NOW OFFERS THE PROSPECT OF COMPELLING ENGLAND
TO MAKE PEACE FEW MONTHS ACKNOWLEDGE RECEIPT.</P>

<P>ZIMMERMANN.<BR>
