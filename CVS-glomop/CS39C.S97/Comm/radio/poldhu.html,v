<H2 ALIGN=CENTER>Marconi Transmitter at Poldhu</H2>

<P>The first transatlantic radio transmissions were made from Poldhu in
1901. This photographs conveys the size of the antenna installation, comprising
twenty 200-foot masts and driven by a 25 kW alternator. Unfortunately, a
gale blew the masts down just before the first test transmissions in December
1901, which were nevertheless successful using a hastily-rigged two-mast
antenna. Early the following year Poldhu communicated through its rebuilt
antenna wuth a ship installation on the Philadelphia out to 700 miles in
daylight and 1550-2100 miles at night, a demonstration of immense consequence
for naval warefare as well as passenger liners.</P>

1991.
