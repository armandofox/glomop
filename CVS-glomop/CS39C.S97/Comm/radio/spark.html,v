<H2 ALIGN=CENTER>The Heart of an Early Transmitter</H2>

<P>Spark gap of a ship's wireless transmitter, circa 1900. The front panel
has been swung down to reveal the device but would be closed in operation
for protection against noise and ozone. The electrical oscilliations inherent
in sparks were conveyed to the antenna through a transformer. The hemispheres
were energized from an induction coil. The development of this technology
was driven equally by naval and civil maritime needs, but its culmination
cane in the First World War for the transmission of wireless telegraphy.</P>

1991.
