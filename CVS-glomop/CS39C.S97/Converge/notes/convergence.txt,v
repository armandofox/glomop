@The Convergence of Computing and Communication (2)

* the Net: not just for email anymore (qualitative vs. quantitative change)

**  the WWW, CERN, NCSA Mosaic, and Netscape
**  data sharing, distributed computing
**  &quot;access is the killer app&quot;
       

* from building-sized to atom-sized: the Big Shrink

** (qualitative vs. quantitative change: laptops, palmtops, pocket-sized)

** "computer containment vehicle of the week"

** "everyone has a cel phone" + "everyone can carry a computer in their pocket"  =  "everyone has an internet appliance"

**  qualitative vs. quantitative change:
         cellular phones, pagers, cordless phones, 2-way
              radios
         less powerful CPU's/embedded controllers for
              tiny appliances
         it's a phone!  it's a computer!  it's a phone
              and a computer! it's&#133;

** show & tell: Nokia 9000              

*  Newly-enabled technologies
       
** "anywhere, anytime" access
** autonomous agents: Agent Tcl
** active badges, ubiquitous computing: "the network is the computer" (who said this?)
** get Marvin Theimer, Doug Terry, or someone from PARC as guest speaker
              
       
* What's it take, really?
       
** Megabits to punybaud: (who said this?) a painful transition
              from wired to wireless paradigm
** Cost &amp; quality of connectivity, tiny devices,
              "different" UI and usage model
** "Meaningful", relevant content presentation
              
** show & tell: proxy for WWW or PDA browser              
       
* The Future
       
** of mobile computing devices/personal communicators
** of the Internet, esp. unwired
** of network-centric vs. "conventional" computing

** "Guess what guys, it's happening again" 
         the  Internet is where the PC was in 1982,  where the cel phone
        was in 1984  
        Java, netcasting
