<H2>Communications Infrastructures</H2>

<P>J. Bray, <I>The Communications Miracle</I>, Plenum Publishing, New York,
1995.</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P><FONT SIZE=-1>A very complete discussion of the development of communications
  technologies. Covers all of the major technologies: wireless telegraphy,
  broadcast radio, television, telephony, and computer networks. Focuses
  extensively on British developments in these areas. The author John Bray
  played a critical role in developing some of the technologies described

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>G. Calhoun, <I>Digital Cellular Radio</I>, Artech House Publishers, Norwood,
MA, 1988.</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P><FONT SIZE=-1>A &quot;management&quot; level discussion of the technology
  of mobile telephony. Very easy to read, but also very verbose. Does not
  require a deep technical background to understand what is being discussed.
  Most of the focus is on cellular telephony, and its migration from analog
  to digital technologies.</FONT></P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>G. Calhoun, <I>Wireless Access and the Local Telephone Network</I>, Artech
House Publishers, Norwood, MA, 1992.</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P><FONT SIZE=-1>A lot of overlap between this book and Calhoun's book
  above. Describes a wide range of mobile and wireless telephone systems.
  </FONT></P>

  <P><FONT SIZE=-1>A popular treatment of the development of packet switching
  networks from the earliest days of the ARPAnet through to the modern Internet.
  Focuses on the personalities that made this technology happen: Baran, Davies,
  Licklider, Taylor, Roberts, Marill, Clark, Heart, Waldon, McQuillan, Crowther,
  Abramson, Metcalf, Kahn, Cerf, etc.</FONT></P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>D. R. Headrick, <I>The Invisible Weapon: Telecommunications and International
Politics 1851-1945</I>, Oxford University Press, New York, 1991.</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P><FONT SIZE=-1>An excellent political analysis of the effects of new
  communications technologies on the world's great powers. Covers the race
  to cover the world with telegraph wires in the 19th century, and how the
  development of radio challenged the existing powers. Good coverage of the
  role of communications in the first and second world wars.</FONT></P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>G. J. Holzman, B. Pehrson, <I>The Early History of Data Networks</I>,
IEEE Press, Los Alamitos, California, 1995.</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P><FONT SIZE=-1>The book does a fine job of describing communications
  from the earliest days of messagers up through the development of the optical
  telegraph. Includes reproduced documents from the early part of the 19th
  Century. Covers the work of Chappe and his contemporaries in England and
  Sweden.</FONT></P>

Naval Institute Press, Annapolis, 1989.</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P><FONT SIZE=-1>Pages 260-264 describe the signaling technology developed
  by the British Royal Navy at the end of the 18th Century. Covers the Howe
  and Popham codes, as well as the shutter telegraph.</FONT></P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>T. Lewis, <I>Empire of the Air: The Men Who Made Radio</I>, HarperPerennial,
New York, 1993.</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P><FONT SIZE=-1>A wonderful book that describes the rise of broadcast
  radio in the early years of this century. Focuses on three key radio pioneers:
  Lee De Forest, who invented the vacuum tube amplifer, Edwin Armstrong,
  who developed frequency modulation, and David Sarnoff, the man who built
  the Radio Corporation of America (RCA) and led it to its dominance in radio
  and television technology development.</FONT></P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>G. Masini, <I>Marconi</I>, Marsilio Publishers, New York, 1996.</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P><FONT SIZE=-1>A biography of the great Marconi. Recently written to
  celebrate the 100th anniversary of the invention of the wireless telegraph.
  Suffers somewhat from a poor translation from the Italian.</FONT></P>

<h2>Computers and Computing Pioneers</h2>

<h3>Surveys and Overviews</h3>

<a name="engines">
<P><b>Joel Shurkin, <i>Engines of the Mind</i></b></p>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P><FONT SIZE=-1>
An excellent general overview of the history of computers from
       earliest times, up through the late 1970's, with detailed
       accounts of the life and times of Babbage, Hollerith, Von
       Neumann, Eckert and Mauchly, and other key players.
</FONT></P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<p>Robert Slater, <i>Portraits in Silicon</i>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT SIZE=-1>
Three-to-five page profiles of pioneers in the history of computing,
from Charles Babbage to Steve Jobs.  Brief but informative.
</FONT></P></blockquote>

<a name="bit">
<p><b>Stan Augarten, <i>Bit By Bit: An Illustrated History of
Computing</i></b></p> 

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT SIZE=-1>
The writer is a journalist and smudges the occasional technical detail,
but on the whole, a concise, entertaining overview of the history of
computing (up to and including Microsoft!) with an abundance of
excellent color photos.
</FONT></P></blockquote>

<h3>The Early Days (Prehistory through 1940)</h3>

<P><font color="#ff0000">George Boole, <i>An Investigation of the Laws
of Thought.</i></font></p> 

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P><FONT SIZE=-1>
The classic paper introducing the laws of Boolean algebra.  The
correspondence between Boolean algebra and binary numbers 
makes binary digital computers possible.
</FONT></P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>W. Aspray et al., <i>Computing Before Computers</i>.</p> 

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P><FONT SIZE=-1>
Describes the highlights of the history of numbers and mathematics
leading up to the inventions we talked about in the first History of
Computing discussion section. Includes excellent explanations and
diagrams of the workings of Napier's bones, the Difference and
Analytical Engines, the mechanical calculators of Schickard and Pascal,
etc. 
</FONT></P>

<h3>Modern Computers (1940 to present)</h3>

<p>Steven Levy, <i>Insanely Great: The Life and Times of Macintosh,
the Computer That Changed Everything</i></p>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT SIZE=-1>
How Steve Jobs's vision for the Macintosh,
based on the Xerox Alto,
changed the way people thought about computers and
"made a dent in the universe".  Excellent account of the
interactions between the "visionaries", management, and hardcore
engineers with a dream.
</FONT></P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<p>Robert X. Cringely, <i>Accidental Empires: How the Boys of
Silicon Valley Make Millions, Battle Foreign Competition, and
Still Can't Get a Date.</i>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT SIZE=-1>
Also see the three-part video
miniseries, <i>Triumph of the Nerds</i>, based on the book and
narrated by the author.  Funny, irreverent, accurate, insider's look at
the computer industry of the 80's and 90's, and how Apple, Microsoft,
Hewlett-Packard,  and
other key players got started and made their fortunes.
</FONT></P></blockquote>

<hr>
<a name="soc">
<h2>Computer Culture, Technology and Society</h2>

<p> Tracy Kidder, <i>The Soul of a New Machine</i></p>

<blockquote><p><font size=-1>
A people-centric account of the design and construction of a
minicomputer of the early eighties, and a great glimpse into the
"corporate culture" of computer design as well as the complexity of the
undertaking itself.
</font></p></blockquote>

<p> Lynn Hershman Leeson (Editor), <i>Clicking In</i></p>

<blockquote><p><font size=-1>
A collection of essays from respected anthropologists, scientists,
hackers, and activists, examining the issues surrounding privacy,
invisibility, and digital culture.
</font></p></blockquote>

<p> Bruce Schneier, <i>Applied Cryptography (2nd Edition)</i></p>

<blockquote><p><font size=-1>
An extensive, in-depth, yet approachable introduction  to the
mathematics, techniques, 
applications, and implications of cryptography.  This is arguably
the best book on cryptography available today.
</font></p></blockquote>

<p> David Kahn, <i>The Codebreakers</i></p>

<blockquote><p><font size=-1> A fascinating and remarkably complete history
of pre-1967 cryptography and cryptographers.  This book helped to bring
cryptography into the public eye for the first time.
</font></p></blockquote>
