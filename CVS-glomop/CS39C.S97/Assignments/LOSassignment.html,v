<H2>Designing a &quot;Line-of-Sight&quot; Communications System</H2>

<P>In this mini-project, we will divide the class into the Blue team and
the Gold team. Each team will be divided into two subteams for alternatively
sending and receiving messages.</P>

<P>Your task will be to design a complete communications system suitable
for transmitting arbitrary messages between Grizzly Peak and the Berkeley
Pier, a distance of about four miles. We may use flashlights, mirrors, or
flags as your signaling medium, and it will be ok to use binoculars or telescopes
to assist in seeing the transmitted message over this distance. <I>No other
form of device will be allowed (in particular, no laptop computers, cellular
phones, packet radios, etc.)!</I></P>

<P>Not only will you design this system, you will also be expected to implement
it and you will compete with the other team to see who has developed the
better system. We will take the two teams to the top of Grizzly and to the
foot of the Berkeley Pier at a prearranged time, and we will provide you
with an on-the-spot series of short messages to be transmitted with your
system from one or the other ends. The team that can transmit the set of
messages in the shortest time and with the fewest errors will be declared
the winner (with bragging rights for the rest of the semester).</P>

<P>While choosing how to encode arbitrary alphanumeric English text will
be a critical aspect of your system (do you use Morse code or some other
signaling system?), you must also think carefully about the control protocols
for your scheme. In designing your system, don't forget to consider the
following questions:</P>

<UL>
  <LI>How is an initial message sequence initiated? That is, how does a sender
  know that the receiver is alert and ready to receive the message? Note
  that the message could originate at either end of the communications link,
  so there should be some method for obtaining the attention of the other
  end of the line. What happens if both sides want to send a message at the
  same time?
  <LI>As each character is sent, is there a signaling handshake to insure
  that the last symbol has been received before the next symbol can begin
  to be sent? Is this done on a character-by-character basis, or is the handshake
  performed over a larger aggregate, such as a phrase or a sentence?
  <LI>Do you have a method to request that the sender retransmit a portion
  of the message if the receiver determines that it is in error?
  <LI>Do you have a method for the receiver to request that the sender send
  faster or slower? Don't forget that both speed and accuracy are important
  metrics of your system.
  <LI>How is the message terminated when you reach the end? How is the system
  reset to begin the process over again for the next message?
</UL>

<P>You will be expected to write a short report that describes your signaling
system and your method for encoding messages. This will be due before the
signaling contest. Then you will a short addition to your report that evaluates
your system in light of how well it performed during the actual test, and
how you would improve it in the future.
