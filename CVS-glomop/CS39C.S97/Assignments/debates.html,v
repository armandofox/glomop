<h2><center>The Great Debates <BR>
CS39C Spring 1997</center></h2>
<BR CLEAR=ALL>

<P>
<hr>

In this assignment, you will be given the opportunity to work in a team
with your classmates and debate the issues that we've discussed in class.
For those of you who have never debated before, debating is a formal
argumentative process that is designed to bring out the issues surrounding
a contentious topic, and sometimes (but extremely rarely) settle the topic.

<P>

The following teams have been selected for the debates:

<P>
<H3>A. Be it resolved that the rights of the government to national security
    supercede the rights of the individual to privacy and anonymity with
    regard to electronic communications and payment.</H3>

<B>Team 1:</B>
<ul>
     <li> Eileen Hohman
     <li> Dave Latham
     <li> Mike Yang
     <li> Nguyen Dang
</ul>
<P>
<B>Team 2:</B>
<ul>
     <li> Tim Kimball
     <li> Tom Pai
     <li> Amy Wang
</ul>
<P>

<H3>B. Be it resolved that electronic media is equivalent to physical
    media for the purposes of intellectual property protection.</H3>

<B>Team 1:</B>
<ul>
     <li> Roger Hsueh
     <li> Matt Gedigian
     <li> Roman Makovitskiy
     <li> Eddy Shao
</ul>
<P>
<B>Team 2:</B>
<ul>
     <li> Eric Jen
     <li> Tom Sha
     <li> Kee Chi
</ul>
<P>


Now that you have been assigned to a team and a debate resolution, your job
will be to meet with your team and prepare debate strategies for <i>both
sides of the resolution</i>.  For example, if the resolution is:

<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><B>Be it resolved that chocolate ice-cream tastes much better
than vanilla ice-cream.</B></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>

then you and your team-mates should be prepared to argue either side of the
resolution.  You will be told whether you are arguing for the positive
(i.e. that chocolate ice-cream tastes much better than vanilla) or the
negative (i.e. that chocolate ice-cream does not taste much better than
vanilla) a few minutes before the debate starts.

<H2>Details about debates</H2>

Each debate will last exactly 34 minutes.  The format of the debates
is as follows:

</TABLE>
</CENTER>

<P>

It is up to your team how to divide the debating responsibilities amongst
the team-members.  The only restriction that we will impose is that
everybody on each team must speak for at least 3 minutes.

<H3>Affirmative Constructive</H3>

In the first speech the affirmative reads their case, and the negative
follows and thinks of arguments against the case. Speak persuasively and
confidently - you are in a position to give the first impression of the
debate.

<P>

<H3>Cross-examination</H3>

In the cross-ex the negative tries to cast doubt upon the affirmative
position. As the questioner, DO NOT MAKE STATEMENTS IN CROSS-EX. Ask
questions and gain answers only. Do not push your opponent for answers -
you aren't Matlock and the judge is going to think you're rude.  However,
don't allow your opponent to evade the question either. Ask again, adding
emphasis to the point your opponent ignored in weaseling out of the
question. You can ask for yes or no answers - don't let them rattle on
forever on an unimportant question. They may ask clarifying questions only,
if they ask other questions you can remind them that this is your
cross-examination and they will have their turn in a few minutes, offer to
answer in your next speech but explain you don't want to take the time to
answer now. In cross-ex try to boil your opponents' case down to a few
simple points relating directly to the values and, not coincidentally,
contradicting directly with your case.

<P>

<H3>Negative Constructive</H3>

In the second speech the negative FIRST reads his or her case, then refutes
their opponents' case. Remember this when writing your negative - it needs
to be 3-4 minutes long or less to allow time for refutation. You should
start by directly relating points in your opponents' case to points in your
case. This will lend validity to your arguments and make it easier to back
up your statements. This is your only chance to bring up new arguments,
however, so be certain to refute any major points your opponent brings
up. Follow up the points and doubts brought up in cross-examination.

<P>

<H3>Cross-examination</H3>
Second cross-ex proceeds much the same as the first.

<P>

<H3>Affirmative/Negative Rebuttal</H3> Rebuttals follow the same rules
outlined for the last half of the first negative. No new points may be
brought up in these speeches, however, though some leniency is granted for
the first affirmative, who of course hasn't had a chance to refute the
negative's case.  A creative affirmative can relate all the negative's
points to the affirmative case, and argue them effectively, still well
within the universal rule of &quot;no new points in rebuttals.&quot;
Back-up evidence is useful but not necessary.  Keep evidence on file for
any points that can't be clearly proven through common-knowledge logic, but
use evidence only as a step in a chain of logic that proves your point.
Remember your last speech is your last chance to make an impression on the
judge.  Ending with a quote or a profound statement can work. Pace yourself
so you don't have to rush through 10,000 little points in the last minute.

<P>

<H3>Last Affirmative Rebuttal</H3> The last affirmative is a special case
in rebuttals. You have very little time to talk, so boiling the whole
(probably confusing) debate down to a few simple points that even a lay
judge can understand is probably to your advantage. CLEARLY state how
you've won the case through value, value criteria, and caseside
points. EVEN IF YOU'RE LOSING MISERABLY. This is your last shot, the
negative doesn't have another chance to talk. Be calm.  The negative
rebuttal does much of the same thing, though with greater caution since the
affirmative DOES have a chance to refute your points. Again, the debate
should be laid out in a few simple points, though the negative has time to
do this with greater detail and care.

Debate teams will be selected and debate resolutions will be posted later
on in the semester.  Once you have been assigned to a team and a debate
resolution, your job will be to meet with your team and prepare debate
strategies for <i>both sides of the resolution</i>.  For example, if the
resolution is:

contradicting directly with your case. As the answerer, answer as clearly
and simply as possible.  Think about your response - don't be afraid to
take some time, it will break your questioner's rhythm. You can talk
forever on one topic and try to take up all the cross examination time, but
it will probably just make you look rude. Have confidence in your case. It
is the answer to all of life's problems, remember? Sound as if you KNEW
they were going to ask that, and are simply trying to let them see the
Great Answer that your case presents.  On either side, be polite, don't get
angry, and look at your judge the whole time. Don't look at your opponent
during the round, watch your judge.

negative's case. Some debaters say that the negative has the burden of
relating all the affirmative's points back to the negative's case, but this
is a nebulous rule and is mostly ignored. In any case, a creative
affirmative can relate all the negative's points to the affirmative case,
and argue them effectively, still well within the universal rule of
&quot;no new points in rebuttals.&quot; Back-up evidence is useful but not
necessary.  Keep evidence on file for any points that can't be clearly
proven through common-knowledge logic, but use evidence only as a step in a
chain of logic that proves your point.  Remember your last speech is your
last chance to make an impression on the judge.  Ending with a quote or a
profound statement can work. Pace yourself so you don't have to rush

<H3>Last Affirmative Rebuttal</H3>
The last affirmative is a special case in rebuttals. You have very little
time to talk, so boiling the whole (probably confusing) debate down to a
few simple points that even a lay judge can understand is probably to your
advantage. CLEARLY state how you've won the case through value, value
criteria, and caseside points. EVEN IF YOU'RE LOSING MISERABLY. This is
your last shot, the negative doesn't have another chance to talk. Be
calm. If the judge thinks you're winning, you are simply validating his or
her opinion. If he or she thinks you're losing and thinks you're faking it
up there, they're only going to vote against you anyway.  It can't hurt to
gloss over the worst inadequacies of your round and highlight the good
points.  The negative rebuttal does much of the same thing, though with
greater caution since the affirmative DOES have a chance to refute your
points. Again, the debate should be laid out in a few simple points, though
the negative has time to do this with greater detail and care.
