<center><H1>CS39C Spring 1997 Assignment 0<BR>
&quot;Getting Your Internet Legs&quot;</H1></center>

<H3>Introduction</H3>

This is, after all, a class about computing and communication, so we'll
be using email and the World Wide Web (WWW) for distributing
materials, pointing you to useful supplementary material that's freely
available, and communicating with each other.  Therefore, knowledge of
how to use the Web and email are <i>required</i> for the class.

<P><CENTER><HR><B>NOTE<BR>
</B>If you don't have an email account, <I>start this assignment early</I>
as it may take a day or two for your account to get set up!<BR>
<HR></CENTER>

<P>If you're familiar with email and WWW surfing, this assignment will
be trivial for you, since it's written for people with no prior Internet
experience. If 
you're not familiar with email and the WWW, no time like the present! By
the end of this assignment you will have done the following, either from
your home computer or one of the General Use Microcomputer Facilities on
the attached campus map:

<UL>
  <LI>Learned the basics of navigating (&quot;surfing&quot;) the WWW by
       visiting the CS39C Home Page, either from your home computer or
       one of the on-campus computers (see map included).
  <LI>Have established an email account at UC Berkeley. 
  <LI>Sent us email from that account, and received our reply; again,
       either from your home computer or one of the on-campus computers.
</UL>

<H3>What Computer Do I Use?</H3>

If you already have Internet access from home, we encourage you to use it
to complete this assignment.<p>

If you don't have Internet access from home, but would like to get it
(which we strongly encourage), this assignment explains how.<p>

If you don't have a computer at home and don't plan to buy one anytime soon,
you can still use the on-campus walk-in microcomputer facilities to do all
the work for this course.<p>


<B>Note</b> that we encourage you to work in pairs or groups for this
assignment, but 
<I>each student must send her/his own email message to get credit
for the assignment.</i><p>

<H3>Surfing the Web</H3>

<OL>
  <LI>Go to one of the facilities, locate an available computer and
       start the Netscape Navigator program, 
       a popular WWW browser. To do this, you'll probably have to
       double-click on the icon representing the program.  (Ask
       the consultant on duty if you need help.)
       <br>
       <UL>
         <LI>Netscape Navigator's icon looks like this:
              <IMG SRC="gifs/image1.gif"
              WIDTH="32" HEIGHT="32" ALIGN="BOTTOM">
       </UL>
       <br>
  <LI>From Netscape's File menu, choose &quot;Open Location&quot;.  Type
       the following location name and then click &quot;Open&quot;.  (Be
       sure to get capitalization correct, and don't insert any extra
       spaces.)<BR> 
       <BR>
       <CENTER><TT>http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~fox/cs39c</TT></CENTER> 
       <br>
       <UL>
         <LI>The location name is called a <I>URL</I>, or <I>Uniform
              Resource Locator</I>. 
              Sometimes it's pronounced like &quot;earl&quot;, other
              times it's pronounced 
              &quot;U-R-L&quot;.  URL's are used to identify
              <I>sites</I> or <I>pages</I> 
              on the Web. 
       </UL>
       <br>
  <LI>The CS39C class <I>home page</I> should appear.  The underlined words
       and blue-framed images on the page are <I>links</I>: clicking on
       them will 
       take you to a page containing information related to the link. For
       example, 
       clicking on the underlined &quot;Prof. Randy H. Katz&quot; will
       take you 
       to Randy's home page.  Explore for a bit by following some of the
       links 
       on the CS39C home page.  You can always retrace your steps by
       clicking the 
       &quot;Back&quot; button (right underneath the &quot;File&quot;
       menu).  
       <br><br>
       <UL>
         <LI>As you can see, there are at least two ways to navigate around the
              WWW: you can either follow a link that connects one page
              to another (using 
              the Back button to retrace your steps), or you can choose
              &quot;Open Location&quot; 
              from the &quot;File&quot; menu and type in the URL you
              wish to go to.  You can use either method at any time.
       </UL>
       <br>
  <LI>Starting from the CS39C home page, locate the page(s) that contain
       links to the reading assignment for 1/30.  (<b>Hint:</b> In the
       syllabus entries for 1/30 on the home page, follow the links for
       the two topics to be discussed next week.)  From now on we won't
       distribute paper copies of any of the readings 
       (unless they can't be found on the Internet); you can read them
       right on the Web, or if you want, print them out to read on paper
       (most of them are pretty short).

</OL>

<H3>Obtaining an Email Account</h3>

(If you already have an email account at Berkeley, skip to the next
section, "Using Email".)<p>

To use email at Berkeley you need two things:
<ul>
  <li> An email account on UCLink4.  You can sign up for this at any of
       the computers in the campus microcomputer facilities.  The consultants
       on duty in the facilities can help you through this process if
       necessary.
  <li> The <b>Eudora</b> program, which lets you receive and send email.
       This program is already installed on all campus microcomputers,
       so you can check your email there.
       If you plan to use email from home, a copy of Eudora is included
       in the Berkeley Internet Kit.
</ul>

Once you have set up your UCLink4 account, go on to the next section...

<H3>Using Email</H3>

Send an email message to me, Armando (that's
<TT>fox@@cs.berkeley.edu</TT>) 
containing the following information:

<ul>
  <li> Your name and email address
  <li> The URL of a cool site of your choice on the Web.  If you don't
       have a favorite site, explore for a while and let serendipity
       guide you  to one; you could even use the class home page as a
       starting point if you're stuck for ideas.  The more obscure, the
       better.
  <li> One thing you liked and one thing you didn't like about the first
       class meeting on 1/23.
</ul>

Once you've sent this email, check your email the next day for a reply
from Armando.

<H3>What If I Need More Help?</H3>

If you want a more in-depth introduction to the Internet, email, or just
using computers in general, IS&amp;T (UC Berkeley Information Systems
&amp; Technology) offers free walk-in classes.  Call 643-6253 for latest
schedules, pick up a printed one at 241 Evans, or visit them on the Web
at <tt><a
href="http://tuna.berkeley.edu/facility">http://tuna.berkeley.edu/facility</a></tt>.<p>


More information about other computing resources at Berkeley can be
found on the Web at <tt><a
href="http://www.berkeley.edu/computing/">http://www.berkeley.edu/computing/
</a></tt>.

<H3>Assignment Checklist</H3>

You should complete this assignment <i>before</i> the next class meeting
on 1/30.  You're done with this assignment when you:
<ul>
  <li> Have successfully viewed the course home page on the Web, either from
       your home computer or one of 
       the campus microcomputer facilities;
  <li> Are confident that you can locate the course readings on the Web
       (and print them if you want);
  <li> Have sent email to Armando as described above, and received a reply
       from him.
  <li> And, after you do the readings for next week, don't forget to
       email Randy your thoughts and opinions on them.
</ul>

<H3>Introduction</H3>
<P>This is, after all, a class about computing and communication, so we'll be
using email and the World Wide Web (WWW) pretty heavily for distributing
materials, pointing you to useful supplementary material that's freely
available, and communicating with each other.</P>
<P>If you're familiar with email and WWW surfing, this assignment will be
easy, since it's written for people with no prior Internet experience.  If
you're not familiar with email and the WWW, no time like the present!  By the
end of this assignment you will have done the following, either from your home
computer or one of the General Use Microcomputer Facilities listed below:</P>
<UL>
  <LI>Learned the basics of navigating ("surfing") the WWW  by visiting the
       CS39C Home Page
  <LI>Learned the basics of using Internet <EM>search engines </EM>to locate
       information on the WWW
  <LI>Have established an email account at UC Berkeley.
  <LI>Sent us email from that account, and received our reply.
  <LI>If you have a computer at home, set it up to connect to the Internet via
       the UC Berkeley dialup facilities (the service is called <EM>Home
       IP</EM> and  
       the software needed to use it is called the <EM>Berkeley Internet
       Kit, </EM>or
