<CENTER> <b>Your write up is due by 4:00pm, Thursday, March 20th 1997.  No
late writeups will be accepted.</b> You may submit your writeup to me
(Steve Gribble) either in hardcopy (by slipping it under the my office door
- 445 Soda Hall) or in softcopy by emailing me a plaintext or postscript
file.  </CENTER>

<P>

In this assignment, you will have the opportunity to use the privacy
enhancing technologies that we discussed in class.  Specifically, you will
get your hands dirty by using both encryption and anonymization technology.

<P>

<B>Your tasks</B>:

<ol>
     <li> <b>Send me (gribble@@cs.berkeley.edu) an encrypted
	  email message, using PGP.</b>  My PGP public
	  key can be found off of my home page, at:
	  <BLOCKQUOTE>
	  <a href="http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~gribble/pgp.html">
	  http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~gribble/pgp.html
	  </a>
	  </BLOCKQUOTE>
	  You can find information about how obtain and use PGP from
	  the <a href="http://www.pgp.com">PGP home page</a> - take a look
	  at the <a
	  href="http://www.pgp.com/products/products.cgi">products</a> list
	  to find freeware implementations of PGP.  Setting up and learning
	  PGP is non-trivial if you haven't done it before, so give
	  yourself time.  <i>If you don't have access to a windows,
	  macintosh, or UNIX account that will allow you to install
	  software, please contact me as soon as possible.</i>
	  <p>
	  In fact, attempting to use PGP by itself is so difficult that I
	  strongly urge you to use a PGP &quot;wrapper&quot; program
	  instead, which greatly simplifies your interaction with PGP.
	  Look at the tools section near the bottom of <a
	  href="http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~raph/remailer-list.html">this
	  page</a> for a list of wrapper programs available for Windows,
	  UNIX, or Macintoshes.

	  <P>
	  <i>Questions:</i> what assurance do you have that the PGP public
	  key you used is in fact mine?  Can you ensure that only you and I
	  can read the message you sent me?

	  <P>
	  
     <li> <b>Send me an anonymized, encrypted email message using a type-1
	  remailer.</b>

	  <P>
	  A list of remailers, and pointers to information on how to use
	  them, can be found <a
	  href="http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~raph/remailer-list.html">here</a>.
	  This page is a little overwhelming - all you need to keep in mind
	  is that &quot;cpunk&quot; or &quot;cypherpunk&quot; class
	  remailers are type 1.  Another good page to visit is 
	  <a href="http://www.stack.nl/~galactus/remailers/">here</a>;  it
	  includes <a href="http://www.replay.com/remailer/chain.html">
	  step-by-step instructions</a> for chaining mail through multiple
	  remailers.  Please identify yourself in your email message.

	  <P>
	  <i>Questions:</i> if you hadn't identified yourself in your email
	  message, could I have verified that you've completed this portion
	  of the assignment?  Who do you have to trust to ensure that your
	  message is kept anonymous?  Can you verify that your message was,
	  in fact, delivered?

	  <P>

     <li> <B>Use a web-based interface to send me anonymous mail.</b>
	  A good one to try is <a
	  href="https://www.replay.com/remailer/anon.html">here</a>.
	  Again, identify yourself in your email message.

	  <P>
	  <i>Questions:</i> now who do you have to trust to ensure that your
	  message is delivered anonymously?  Is the web-based interface any
	  stronger or weaker?

	  <P>	  
     <li> <B>Use either a web-based anonymizer or one of the type-1 remailers
	  to post an anonymous newsgroup message, to the newsgroup
	  &quot;ucb.class.cs39c&quot;.</b>  Please identify yourself in the
	  body of the newsgroup posting.  <i>(You should be
	  able to track down instructions on how to do post anonymous
	  messages on your own.  Hint:  some of the previous links I gave
	  you are a good place to start looking.  If you cannot figure out
	  how to post unanonymous mail, contact me.)</i>

	  <P>
	  <i>Question (harder):</i> can you think of a way to use anonymous
	  newsgroup posting to set up a two-way, anonymous flow of messages
	  between two people?

	  <P>
	  
     <li> <b>Using a web anonymizer (for example, <a
	  href="http://www.anonymizer.com">C2Net's anonymizer</a>), visit
	  the page <a href="http://latte.cs.berkeley.edu/index.html">
	  http://latte.cs.berkeley.edu/index.html</a>.</b>

	  <P>
	  <i>Questions:</i> who do you need to trust to ensure that your
	  web browsing is anonymized?  Did you notice anything peculiar
	  about the web page that I asked you to visit?
	  
</ol>

Once you have completed all of these tasks, write up your experiences and
answers to the questions posed.  (This should take about 2-4 pages.) Try to
explain what was difficult, what was easy, and how much knowledge of the
underlying technology you needed in order to complete each task.
