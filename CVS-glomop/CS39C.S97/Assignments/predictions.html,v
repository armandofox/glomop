<title>Assignment #4: Outrageous Predictions for the Future</title>
</head>

<body BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF">
<h2>CS39C Assignment #4</h2>
<h3>Outrageous Predictions for the Future</h3>

<p>So you've read about the past, the state of the art, and what
visionaries and crackpots of yesterday  have had to say about their
future (i.e. today), and what today's visionaries and crackpots have had
to say about the future.  You've heard what people have to say on both
sides of the argument for all sorts of societal implications of computer
technology: personal privacy and freedom, intellectual property, censorship.

<p> Now it's time for <i>you</i> to become a visionary or crackpot,
preferably the former.  You are going to prepare for this week's class
by temporarily donning your prophet's hat and making some outrageous
predictions regarding the future of computing, communications, or their
impact on the world.  Specifically,  pick <b>two</b> of the
three main subject areas we covered in the course (communications,
computing,  societal impact), and for each of these 2 areas
that you select,

<ol>
     <li> Prepare a (short) writeup containing:
	  <ul>
	       <li> your &quot;outrageous&quot; prediction for the state of
		    affairs and/or future developments in this area.  We'd
		    like you to make your prediction for 8-15 years from now
		    (i.e. approximately the year 2010).  Be creative with
		    your predictions!
	       <li> supporting evidence for your prediction.  This evidence
		    should point to the technological, economic, or cultural
		    trends that led you to your prediction and that would
		    convince us that you are likely to be correct.  Simply
		    saying &quot;because that would be cool&quot; isn't
		    enough support.  
	       <li> the strongest counter-argument to your prediction that
		    you can come up with.  What is most likely to cause
		    your prediction to not come true?
	  </ul>
     <li> Be prepared to present your prediction to the class.  This needn't
	  be a formal presentation; simply be ready to say a few sentences on
	  what you came up with and why, and perhaps prod your classmates
	  into discussing the issue.  We will discuss as many of the
          predictions as we have time for, so it is very likely we'll 
          ask you to
	  say something about your idea.  You're encouraged to use things
          that have come up in class discussions or in the readings to
          support (or refute!) your predictions.
</ol>


<b>Turn in your writeup in class this Thursday (May 8th, 1997).</b><p>

To inspire you as to what <i>not</i> to say, <a
href="http://ei.cs.vt.edu/~history/humor.html">here</a> are a few gems
from the Computer History Archives at Virginia Tech.  <p>

And as always....don't stress, this is supposed to be enjoyable.

	  what you came up with and way, and perhaps prod your classmates
	  into discussing the issue.  We will pick what we think are the
	  more interesting predictions for discussion - we'll probably pick
	  more than half of them, so it is very likely we'll call on you to
	  say something about your idea.
