</P>

<P>It has long been the dream of humankind to be able to communicate any
where, any place, and any time. The possession of such an ability, and the
timely information it would provide, would ensure the power of kings, nation
states, and business cartels. So it is not surprising that communications
was among the first examples of state-sponsored research.</P>

<P>In this seminar, we will discuss the history and evolution of communications
systems and computing devices, from the days of Ancient Greece to the present.
We will examine how the inventors of early systems developed features such
as secret codes, error correction, and &quot;traffic control,&quot; which
are common in today's communications infrastructures. We will also describe
the scientists, inventors, and entrepreneurs who made today's trillion dollar
information and communications industry possible. In a similar fashion,
we will examine how the evolution of computers has recently resulted in
pocket-sized devices that communicate over the airwaves, and how the convergence
of mobile computing and communications is finally allowing us to realize
the &quot;information anywhere, any place, anytime&quot; vision.</P>

<TD WIDTH="17%"><IMG SRC="gifs/greek.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM" WIDTH="57" HEIGHT="96" NATURALSIZEFLAG=

<TD WIDTH="83%">A discussion of the earliest forms of sending messages over great distances:
runners (where does the marathon come from?), horse relays (before the Pony
express!), homing pigeons, smoke signals (Polybius' alphabetic code), torch
signaling, heliographs (flashing mirrors), signal flags (especially in the
Navy). Recurring themes: methods for efficiently coding information, ways
to insure the secrecy of information being transmitted, what it takes to
construct infrastructures that span a region, how to synchronize senders
and receivers, the separation of control messages from data message.</TD></TR>

and secret writing. &quot;Telegraph: writing at a distance.&quot; Information
traveling faster than the quickest form of transportation. Development of
the optical telegraph (aka &quot;wig wag&quot;) in the late 18th Century.
Deployment of the first optical telegraph SYSTEM in France and its use in
the French Revolution and the Napoleanic wars. 5000 km and 556 stations
by mid-1800s. First recorded use of error control (resend a lost character),
flow control (send faster, send slower), and message priority. Alternative
systems, such as the octal encoded shutter systems of England and Sweden.</TD></TR>

<H3>Lecture 2: The First Global Information Infrastructure</H3>

<H4>&quot;What Hath God Wrought&quot;: The Electromechanical Telegraph</H4>

<P>Electromagnetism discoveries (e.g., Cooke and Wheatstone) leading up
to Samuel F. B. Morse's invention of the Morse Code and his system for its
transmission in 1844. First U.S. government funded demonstration: Morse's
system between Baltimore and Washington. Telegraphy and its relationship
to the railroads. The inventor as an entrepreneur and how the telegraph
infrastructure was financed and deployed in US and elsewhere. The impact
of telegraphy on the American Civil War.</P>

<H4>The International Telegraph Union</H4>

<P>The history of international agreements related to mail carrage across
borders. The need for standardization and international treaties to interconnect
national telegraphic systems at national borders. The development of submarine
telegraph cables and the great adventure to span the Atlantic in 1850s and
60s, and then the world. Lord Kelvin's contributions to long distance, submarine
telegraph technology. The nationally sponsored telegraphic cartels. Communications
as a driver of imperialism and international politics: the desire for the
&quot;all red&quot; route.</P>
