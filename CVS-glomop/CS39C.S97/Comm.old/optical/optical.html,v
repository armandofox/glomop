<H1>Napoleon's Secret Weapon</H1>

<P><HR ALIGN=LEFT></P>

<H4><A HREF="fig11.html"><IMG SRC="../gifs/statue.gif" WIDTH="59" HEIGHT=
"88" NATURALSIZEFLAG="0" ALIGN="LEFT"></A>Claude Chappe</H4>

<P><STRONG>1763 AD</STRONG>: Birth of Claude Chappe, Grandson of a French
Baron, trained for the church.</P>

<P>Loses his religious benefices in the wake of the French revolution in
1783. Decides to work with his brothers on the problem of the optical telegraph.</P>

<H4>Early Experiment: The Synchronized System (1791)</H4>

<P>Pendulum clocks used at the end points (400 meters apart). 16 numerials
on clock face. Message encoded as a sequence of numerials. When sending
clock reaches the desired numerial to be sent next, a loud sound is made
which can be heard at the receiver. Receiver clock face indicates the next
numerial in the sequence. Agreed upon sound is used to cause the pendulum
weights at the sender and the receiver to be dropped in synchrony. (Note:
signal flags could be used as well as sounds.)</P>

<P>Considered using electrical means to transmit signals, but adequate insulation
to did not exist at this time.</P>

<P>Sought financial support from the Legislative Assembly to build an operational
telegraph system in Paris.</P>

<H4>The Second Experiment: The Panel Telegraph (1792)</H4>

<P>Rectangular wooden frame with five sliding panels that could be displayed
or obscured via pulleys. Implements a 5-bit binary code (32 combinations).
A system very similar to this was eventually developed by the British and
the Swedes.</P>

<P>A mob destroyed the experiment: suspected of being a subversive instrument
meant to communicate with France's enemies.</P>

<P><STRONG>1792 AD</STRONG>: Assembly replaced by the National Convention,
Louis XVI placed in prison and the Republic declared. 1793 brings the Reign
of Terror. Chappe maintains a low profile.</P>

<H4>The Third Experiment: The Semaphore Telegraph (1793)</H4>

<P><A HREF="fig1.html"><IMG SRC="../gifs/optical.gif" WIDTH="67" HEIGHT=
"95" NATURALSIZEFLAG="0" ALIGN="LEFT"></A>Horizontal beam (called the &quot;regulator&quot;)
+ two smaller wing beams (called the &quot;indicators&quot;). Could be varied
in 45 degree increments. Claims that this is easier to see than the shutter
system.</P>

<P>National Assembly votes 6000 francs to Chappe to build the system. First
recorded use of the term <EM>telegraph</EM>: &quot;far writing.&quot;</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<H5>12 July 1793: A Critical Test</H5>

<P>Three location selected, 15 km first hop and 11 km second hop</P>

<P>11 minutes to transmit the original 27 word message. Answer arrives 9
minutes later.</P>

<P>26 July 1793: decision to build a French state telegraph at a cost of
58,400 francs. 15 stations spanning from Paris to Lille (120 miles North
of Paris).</P>

<P><A HREF="fig9.html"><IMG SRC="../gifs/gears.gif" WIDTH="53" HEIGHT="70"
NATURALSIZEFLAG="0" ALIGN="LEFT"></A>Breguet, the famous French watchmaker,
assists in designing the intricate pulley and gearing systems necessary
to operate the telegraph.</P>

<P>30 April 1794: Line completed and initial testing of the system.</P>

<P>16 July 1794: Line declared open.</P>

<P>15 August 1794: First official message: reporting recapture of the city
of LeQuesnoy from the Austrians and the Prussions.</P>

<P>3 October 1794: A second line authorized from Paris to Metz/Strasbourg,
on France's Eastern frontier.</P>

<H4><A HREF="fig5.html"><IMG SRC="../gifs/optical5.gif" WIDTH="73" HEIGHT=
"73" NATURALSIZEFLAG="0" ALIGN="RIGHT"></A>Improvements to the System</H4>

<OL>
  <LI>Auxiliary stations built to be used when visibility was poor.
  <LI>Increased the size of the regulator: from 4 m to 15 m.
  <LI>Investigated a new design based on 7 arms rather than 2. Increases
  the code space and reduces the amount of time to send a message. Suggested
  by Gaspard Monge, a mathematician.
  <LI>Developed a new signaling code.
</OL>

<H4>Emergence of a Network</H4>

<P>1799: Napoleon seizes power. Sends the message &quot;Paris is quiet and
the good citizens are content.&quot; via optical telegraph. Declares himself
Emperor in 1804.</P>

<P>By 1800, telegraph stations spread N, S, E, W from Paris across the whole
country. Stations placed approximately 6 miles apart. By 1803, line began
to be extended to Italy, Belgium. Completed in 1814.</P>

<P>Lines divided into short, autonomous segments called divisions. Messages
decoded and logged at start and end of each division. Operators at intermediate
stations did not know the complete code, only a subset of control codes.</P>

<P>1804: Government consistently late in providing funds for line construction.
Adversaries attack his designs, claiming credit for themselves. Chappe falls
ill on an inspection tour of the lines. Depressed, he commits suicide in
1805.</P>

<P><A HREF="fig8.html"><IMG SRC="../gifs/crimea.gif" WIDTH="83" HEIGHT=
"66" NATURALSIZEFLAG="0" ALIGN="LEFT"></A>Chappe's brothers continue to
develop and expand the system. Mobile semaphose system developed in 1812,
and still in use duing the Crimean War (1853 - 1856). Expansion within France
continues until 1853, when it is finally replaced by electric telegraph.</P>

<P>Traffic averaged a few hundred messages per year. Grew to 556 stations
covering 3000 miles linking the 29 largest French cities. Over 1000 people
employed.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<H4>Fraud</H4>

<P>Need to guard the secrecy of transmissions.</P>

<P><STRONG>1836</STRONG>: Operator brided to introduce a specific pattern
of errors into a transmission about the direction of the Paris stock market.
Taken advantage of by accomplices in Bordeaux. System was circumvented at
the Divisional boundaries.</P>

<H4>Operation of the Telegraph</H4>

<H5>Mechanical Design</H5>

<P>Complex pulley and gear system controlled the position of the regulator
and the two wings.</P>

<H5>First Code</H5>

<P>Virtually impossible to send messages in relay fashion with no errors.</P>

<P>Decimal encodings: 1-9: most frequent words, single signal; 10-99, two
signals; 100 to 999, three signals; 1000 to 9999, four signals;</P>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="../gifs/encoding.gif" WIDTH="288" HEIGHT="59"
ALIGN="BOTTOM" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></P>

<P>Note that the regulator is in either the horizontal or vertical position
(no 45 degree variations), and only one of the indicators is used (again,
no 45 degree variations are used).</P>

<P><A HREF="fig2.html"><IMG SRC="../gifs/optical1.gif" WIDTH="60" HEIGHT=
"64" NATURALSIZEFLAG="0" ALIGN="LEFT"></A>Could be extended to a base-20
number system as follows: precede with a prefix signal--regulator 45 degrees
right oblique or left oblique position. Former indicates odd number, latter
indicates even number. Could be used to reduce the number of symbols needed
to identify a phrase in a code book. Proposed, but never actually used.</P>

<P>Note that the operators at stations inside the divisions only knew the
numerials, not how these mapped onto actual letters and phrases.</P>

<P>Control signals: both indicators turned away to avoid ambiguity with
the basic numerial codes.</P>

<UL>
  <LI>Start of transmission
  <LI>End of transmission
  <LI>Suspension of transmissions for one hour
  <LI>Suspension of transmissions for two hours
  <LI>Synchronization, meant to allow the stations along the telegraph line
  to resynchronize their clocks
  <LI>Conflict, to indicate that two messages from opposite directions had
  arrived simultaneously at one station
  <LI>Priority, to indicate the precedence of one of the conflicting messages
  <LI>Acknowledgement, indicating the reception of a correctly deciphered
  message at the final destination
  <LI>Error, to cancel the last transmitted sign
  <LI>Idle, indicating the closing of the station or line
  <LI>Minor failure, to indicate a small problem with the telegraph, or the
  temporary absence of the operator
  <LI>Major failure, to indicate a more serious problem disabling the telegraph,
  requiring outside help
  <LI>Rain or fog restricting visibility
  <LI>Night transmission (no record of the system ever being used at night,
  however)
</UL>

<H4>The Revised Code</H4>

<P><A HREF="fig3.html"><IMG SRC="../gifs/optical2.gif" WIDTH="106" HEIGHT=
"75" NATURALSIZEFLAG="0" ALIGN="LEFT"></A>Question: What is the maximum
number of semaphore configurations, assuming that the regulator and the
indicators can be placed in arbitrary 45 degree positions?</P>

<UL>
  <LI>8 x 8 x 4 = 256 configurations
  <LI>But positions with indicators extended and hidden behind the regulator
  are difficult to distinguish visually: 7 x 7 x 4 = 196 configurations
  <LI>What if regulator restricted to horizontal or vertical direction only:
  7 x 7 x 2 = 98 configurations
  <LI>4 - 6 reserved for special indications, leaving 92 - 94 for data; for
  example, horizontal and vertical regulator position with indicators folded
  in
</UL>

<H5>Code Structure</H5>

<P><A HREF="fig4.html"><IMG SRC="../gifs/optical3.gif" WIDTH="64" HEIGHT=
"108" NATURALSIZEFLAG="0" ALIGN="LEFT"></A>First part of the code: 94 different
signs to encode the alphabet, numerials, and frequently used syllables.
Set and confirmed by folding in the two indicators (called <EM>closing</EM>).</P>

<P>Second part of code: 94 pages with 94 symbols on each page. More symbols
and common words. First signal gives line number, second signal gives page
number.</P>

<P>94 + 94 x 94 = 8930 words and phrases.</P>

<P>Question: Chappe added three additional parts to the code. How did he
do it?</P>

<UL>
  <LI>Used a special signal, a horizontal double-crossed signal, to indicate
  the third part.
  <LI>Used a vertical double-crossed signal to indicate the fourth part.
  <LI>Borrowed a signal from the first part to indicate the fifth part.
</UL>

<P>First and second parts used two signals; third and fourth used three;
fifth used four.</P>

<H5>Forming a Signal</H5>

<P>First step: formation of signal</P>

<P>Second step: confirmation/completion of the signal</P>

<P>Third step: close the signal</P>

<OL>
  <LI>Tilt regulator beam to the left (left oblique) or right (right oblique),
  with indicators folded in. The regulator in this position is not a valid
  signal.
  <LI>Move regulator back to horizontal or vertical position, &quot;carrying
  the signal to completion.&quot;
  <LI>Close the signal by folding in the indicators.
</OL>

<P>Message signals formed on the left oblique. Control signals formed on
the right oblique.</P>

<P>Each signal passed one at a time from one end of the system to its destination.
Operator must verify that next station in the system correctly reproduced
the signal. Otherwise send error signal.</P>

Swedish Aristocrat Edelcrantz designs a matrix of 3 x 3 shutters, with a
10th extra large shutter on top. First link went from Stockholm to the Fortress
of Vaxholm. Spreads quickly through Sweden, driven by fear of invasion during
the Napoleonic Wars.</P>

<P>Used octal encoding: from top to bottom 1, 2, 4. Each column represents
a signal number in the range 0 through 7. Full telegraph could send 000-777
