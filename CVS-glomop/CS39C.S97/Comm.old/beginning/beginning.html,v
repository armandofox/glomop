<P><HR ALIGN=LEFT></P>

<H3>What does it take to send a message?</H3>

<P>Try an experiment: the party game of telephone</P>

<UL>
  <LI>An initial message is whispered to the first person in the chain
  <LI>He or she repeats it to the next person in the sequence
  <LI>At the end, the message usually come out quite differently than when
  it started!
</UL>

<P>Sending a message <EM>reliably</EM> is not as easy it seems.</P>

<P>Thought experiment #1: how to send a message via smoke signals</P>

<UL>
  <LI>Need to <EM>encode</EM> the message in series of smoke puffs
  <LI>Smoke puffs can be long or short: these are the <EM>symbols</EM> in
  the smoke alphabet
  <LI>Certain patterns of long and short puffs could represent a pre-arranged
  signal (&quot;the enemy is coming!&quot;)
  <LI>Or map certain sequences in the smoke alphabet to letters (a short
  puff = &quot;a&quot;, a long puff = &quot;b&quot;, two short puffs = &quot;c&quot;,
  and so on).
  <LI>This leads to a series of questions:
  <UL>
    <LI>How many sequences do we need to encode messages in English?
    <LI>How do we indicate the start and end of a message?
    <LI>How do we know that the intended receiver got the message?
    <UL>
      <LI>&quot;Ready to send&quot; &quot;Clear to send&quot; <EM>handshake</EM>
    </UL>
  </UL>
</UL>

<P>Thought experiment #2: how to send a message via runners</P>

<UL>
  <LI>Write down the message and give it to a runner to deliver it to the
  intended receiver
  <UL>
    <LI>Many receivers can see the smoke signals at the same time. This is
    <EM>broadcast</EM> communications.
    <LI>Runner can deliver the message to only one receipient at a time. This
    is <EM>point-to-point </EM>communications.
  </UL>
  <LI>How do we know that the message was received?
  <UL>
    <LI>We can expect an <EM>acknowledgement</EM> return message, sent from
    the recipient back to the sender via the runner.
    <LI>We can wait for a certain period of time to receive the acknowledge.
    If the time expires (<EM>times out</EM>), we send the message again.
  </UL>
  <LI>What happens if an enemy intercepts the message?
  <UL>
    <LI>The message could be written in code (<EM>cryptography</EM> = secret
    writing)
    <UL>
      <LI><CODE>A very simple transposition code:</CODE>
      <LI><CODE>A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z</CODE>
      <LI><CODE>B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z A</CODE>
      <LI><CODE>this is a secret message</CODE>

    </UL>
  </UL>
</UL>

<P>Key elements of building a communications systems:</P>

<OL>
  <LI>Messages are constructed from symbols in a basic alphabet.
  <LI>Each symbol can represent a complete message or symbols can be composed
  to construct arbitrary messages.
  <LI>A signaling convention is needed to ensure that the receiver has seen
  the symbol being sent before the next symbol can be sent.
  <LI>It is useful if the receiver can signal to the sender to &quot;send
  faster&quot; or &quot;slow down.&quot; This is called <EM>flow control</EM>.
  <LI>A signaling convention is needed to ensure that the receiver has received
  the entire message before the next message can be sent. This is called
  <EM>error control</EM>.
  <LI>It is useful if the receiver has some method for determining if the
  message is correct, before sending it on. This is called <EM>error checking</EM>.
  <LI>If messages are to be kept secret, they can be encoded using cryptography.
  This process is called <EM>encryption</EM>.

<H3>Historical Discussion</H3>

<H4>Human Messengers</H4>

<P><STRONG>490 BC</STRONG>: Phidippides runs from Marathon to Athens (36.2
km, 22.5 miles) to warn the Athenians of an approaching Persian army (he
supposedly died from the strain!).</P>

<P>Human messagers on foot or horseback in Egypt (Second Millennium BC)
or China (First Millennium BC). Relay stations on major roads.</P>

<P><STRONG>approx. 650 BC</STRONG>: Babylonian kings place guard stations
along major roads. Messages travel by relay courier from one station to
the next. Fire beacons introduced to permit signaling from one station to
the next without the need for human runners.</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P><FONT SIZE=-1>&quot;We have observed still another device of Cyrus'
  (King of Persia, circa 530 BC) for coping with the magnitude of his empire;
  by means of this institution he would speedily discover the condition of
  affairs, no matter how far distant they might be from him: he experimented
  to find out how great a distance a horse could cover in a day when ridden
  hard, but not so hard as to break down, and then he erected post-stations
  at just such distances and equipped them with horses, and men to take care
  of them; at each one of the stations he had the proper official appointed
  to receive the horses and riders and send on fresh ones. They say, moreover,
  that sometimes this express does not stop all night, but the night-messengers
  succeed the day messengers in relays, and when this is the case, this express,
  some say, gets over ground faster than the cranes.&quot; Xenophon (430-355
  BC) in <EM>Cyropaedia</EM>.</FONT></P>

<P><STRONG>14 AD</STRONG>: Roman relay system</P>

<UL>
  <LI>80 km (50 miles) per day for regular mail
  <LI>160 km (100 miles) per day for express mail
</UL>

<P><STRONG>1280 AD</STRONG>: Kublai Khan</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P><FONT SIZE=-1>&quot;Let us turn now to the system of post-horses by
  which the Great Khan sends his dispatches. You must know that the city
  of Khan-balik is a centre from which many roads radiate to many provinces,
  one to each, and every road bears the name of the province to which it
  runs. The whole system is admirably contrived. When one of the Khan's messengers
  sets out along any of these roads, he has only to go 25 miles and there
  he finds a posting station. Here the messengers find no less than 400 horses,
  stationed here by the Great Khan's orders and always kept in readiness
  for his messengers when they are sent on any mission. And you must understand
  that posts such as these, at distances of 25 or 30 miles, are to be found
  along all of the main highways leading to the provinces. The whole organization
  is so stupendous and so costly that it baffles speech and writing.&quot;

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P><FONT SIZE=-1>&quot;The pidgeon took just half the time and less than
  1% of the dollar amount of the car. Over a 16-month period the pidgeons

<H4>Mirrors and Flags</H4>

<P>How do you transmit messages faster than is possible with (human, horse,
or bird) muscle power?</P>

<H5>Heliographs</H5>

<P>Using mirrors to signal messages: helio = sun, graph = to write, that
is, write with the sun.</P>

<P><STRONG>37 AD</STRONG>: Used by the Roman Emperor Tiberius</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P><FONT SIZE=-1>&quot;For nearly ten years during the reign of the wise
  but unpopular emperor Tiberius, Rome was ruled from the island of Capri.
  Each day he sent orders to the mainland by a type of &quot;heliograph&quot;
  which transmitted the sun's rays by means of a mirror of polished metal.&quot;</FONT></P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>There is some dispute about whether Tiberius used mirrors or some form
of signal torches.</P>

<P><A HREF="fig2.html"><IMG SRC="../gifs/helograph.gif" WIDTH="101" HEIGHT=
"28" ALIGN="BOTTOM" NATURALSIZEFLAG="0"></A><STRONG>1810 AD</STRONG>:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P><FONT SIZE=-1>&quot;Prof. Gauss ... invented a device to direct a controlled
  beam of sunlight to a distant station. It included &quot;silvered and unsilvered
  mirrors&quot; fixed at right angles to each other. The operator looked
  in the unsilvered mirror at the distant station. Then he turned both mirror's
  so the sun's image (reflected faintly from the plain surface of the unsilvered
  mirror) was superimposed over the distant station, automatically directing
  the beam from the silvered mirror in the same direction.&quot;</FONT></P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="../gifs/helio.gif" WIDTH="281" HEIGHT="99" ALIGN=
"BOTTOM" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></P>

<P>This device was extensively used by the British and American armies as
a &quot;wireless&quot; field telegraph. In 1869, Henry Mance added movable
mirror so device could be used to signal Morse code. Used extensively in
British India up to 1890.</P>

<P>Used by U.S. General Miles in battles with Native Americans in Arizona
in the late 1880s. Set up 27 signaling stations, 40-50 km apart. Averaged
about 16 words per minute.</P>

<P><STRONG>1851 AD</STRONG>: Charles Babbage invents a light-flashing machine,
the &quot;occulting telegraph:&quot;</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P><FONT SIZE=-1>&quot;I then, by means of a small clock-work and an argand
  lamp, made a numerical system of occultation, by which any number might
  be transmitted to all those within sight of a source of light.&quot;</FONT></P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>What happens if the day is overcast? Or if the sun is behind your back?</P>

<H5>Flags</H5>

<P>Signaling with coded flags</P>

<P>Early references in Plutarch (46-120 AD) about Greek naval battles circa
410 BC.</P>

<P><STRONG>900 AD</STRONG>: Byzantine Navy:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P><FONT SIZE=-1>&quot;During naval operations, the captains of the ships
  were expected to observe the &quot;pamphylus&quot; of the admiral, who
  gave orders by signaling from different sides and heights of the central
  flagship with banners of various colors, or with firs and smoke. A whole
  code of signals existed with which the commanders and their crews had to
  be acquainted.&quot;</FONT></P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><STRONG>1738 AD</STRONG>: de la Bourdonnais introduces numerical code
for flags. 10 colored flags indicating the numerials 0-9. 3 sets of flag
yield 1000 different signals.</P>

<P>Question: to represent the 26 letters of the alphabet and the ten numerials,
what is the minimum number of flags you would need using a system along
the lines of de la Bourdonnais?</P>

<UL>
  <LI>36 flags maximum, one for each symbol.
  <LI>or 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 x 2, 12 flags in a binary code
  <LI>or 4 x 4 x 3, 11 flags in a quartary code
  <LI>or 8 x 5, 13 flags in an octal code
  <LI>In each of the cases, it is just as easy to represent 64 unique configurations
  of the flags, so add a variety of special, frequently encountered messages
  that receive their own unique flag code.
