<title>Next Time We Teach CS39C</title>
</head>

<body>

<h1>Next Time</h1>

<h3>Class logistics</h3>
<ul>
  <li> Bold predictions/Panel sessions were very successful, have them
       regularly.
  <li> More show and tell
  <li> Structured participation to encourage shyer people
  <li> meet twice a week for an hour instead of once for 1.5 hours
  <li> Revisit organization of material: maybe "blocks" on computing and
       communication, interspersed with societal implications at the
       appropriate times, and then a few sessions on convergence
  <li> Select particularly interesting/insightful comments from
       summaries for class discussion
  <li> Impose some regular structure on summaries -- too much disparity
       in effort right now
</ul>

<h3>Class materials</h3>
<ul>
  <li> better integration of videos and other media
       <ul>
         <li> "Telephone"
         <li> "Triumph of the nerds"
         <li> "Silicon run"
       </ul>
  <li> Reader
  <li> uniformize and spiffify course Web pages
  <li> "Threaded tours by topic" for course Web pages (see, e.g.,
       <a
       href="http://www5conf.inria.fr/fich_html/papers/P30/Overview.html">Supporting
       Hierarchical Guided Tours in the World Wide Web</a>
</ul>


<h3>Field trips</h3>
<ul>
  <li> Have students pick one or two "thematic questions" that they try
       to investigate/get answered during field trip, and write up results.

  <li> UCB Microlab tour:
       <ul>
         <li> Watch "silicon run" or similar video in advance
         <li> Some class discussion about video, real-life fabs, etc.
         <li> Brief tour guides on tech. level of students
         <li> Assignment: everyone bring 1 question
       </ul>
  <li> Soda network infrastructure/NOW machine room:  guided/annotated
       tour will be easy, maybe get 
       one of our infrastructure guys (Ken, Eric Fraser, Brian S.) to
       talk about the network infrastructure
  <li> Computer museum (Moffett Field)
  <li> Marconi Center (Pt. Reyes)-  photographs, transmitter base blocks, ...
  <li> Nextel Switch - rooms full of boxes with flashing lights
  <li> KTVU in Oakland - channel 2 tv studio - Cindy Manly-Field's husband
       is a broadcast engineer.       jack london square
  <li> Intel museum
  <li>Tech museum in San Jose?
  <li> Bernstein case trial?
  <li> CFP or other conference?
</ul>

<h3>Feedback from students in course eval</h3>

<ul>
  <li> Too much emphasis on early history
  <li> Too much to read, sometimes needless detail (pick them more
       carefully)
  <li> More projects please
  <li> More class time spent on each topic (at least 1 person suggested
       2 hrs/week instead of 1.5.  Maybe two 1-hr meetings?)
</ul>
