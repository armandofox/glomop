<title>ENIAC, IBM and the Seven Dwarfs</title>
</head>

<h1>Discussion: IBM and the Seven Dwarfs</h1>

<h3>Eckert, Mauchly and Co.</h3>

<ul>
  <li> Why do we think of ENIAC as the archetype of the modern
       electronic computer?  What did it have that its predecessors lacked
       (Hollerith's tabulator, Babbage's engines, Zuse's and Pascal's
       calculators)?
       <ul>
         <li> Automatic?
         <li> Digital?
         <li> Stored-program?
       </ul>
  <li> What do <i>you</i> think was Von Neumann's role?
  <li> Why were MIT and the National Defense Research Consortium
       so disdainful of Eckert and Mauchly's electronic digital computer
       ideas?  It helped ENIAC's credibility to have Von Neumann aboard.
  <li> Would you hire these guys to design your computers?  How about to
       run your business?
  <li> What were the "breakthroughs" (if any) demonstrated by ENIAC?
  <li> EMCC ended up "the big loser in the field its founders
       pioneered."  Has this happened in recent history?  To whom, and why?
</ul>

<h3>Intellectual Property Rears Its Ugly Head (Revisited)</h3>
<ul>
  <li> Who should get patent rights and royalties when a piece of
       academic research becomes commercially successful?  Here are some
       points to think about:
       <ul>
         <li> The University researchers may be public employees (in the
              case of public universities, like Berkeley).
         <li> Even at private nonprofit universities, the work is being
              funded by 
              Government grants, which come mostly from taxpayer dollars.
         <li> University researchers (and certainly graduate students!)
              usually earn less money and have a
              more austere lifestyle than corporate executives or
              industry lab researchers.
         <li> University research undertakes projects that most
              companies won't touch because they're not obviously
              commercially viable.  If not for the universities, nobody
              would do this.
       </ul>
  <li> Does the patent system do more harm than good?  That is, does it
       primarily protect and reward inventors while still allowing
       society to reap the benefits of their inventions, or does it
       enrich the wrong people and act as an obstacle to the creative
       process?
  <li> Discuss FUD.  Do we see it today?  From what companies?  Is this
       good for business?  Good for the computer-using world?
  <li> Who invented the modern electronic digital computer?
       <ul>
         <li> John Vincent Atanasoff, who demonstrated the  earliest version
              of a totally electronic, vacuum-tube-based binary adder?
         <li> John von Neumann, who "evangelized" the stored-program
              computer concept to such a degree that to this day the
              model is known as the "von Neumann machine"?
         <li> J. Presper Eckert and John Mauchly, who built ENIAC and
              founded Univac, the first vendor of electronic
              general-purpose computers for business, based on the
              concept?
         <li> Charles Babbage and Ada Lovelace, whose machines and ideas
              clearly foreshadowed everything that was soon to come?
       </ul>
</ul>

<h3>The Patent System and Patent Attorneys</h3>

Here's what some prominent inventors have had to say about the patent
system, patent litigation, and patent attorneys.  Some things to think
about or investigate:
<ul>
  <li> What situations led these scientists and inventors to speak as
       they do?
  <li> Does the patent system do more harm than good?  That is, does it
       primarily protect and reward inventors while still allowing
       society to reap the benefits of their inventions, or does it
       enrich the wrong people and act as an obstacle to the creative
       process? 
</ul>

<blockquote>
Say I have lost all faith in patents, judges and everything related to
patents.  Don't care if the whole system is squelched.<br>
Thomas Edison
</blockquote>

<br>

<blockquote>You have now filed the last patent you will ever file in my
name.  I will make claim to nothing, because what you are doing is
destroying a group that has the capability of producing great
things. You're divisive.
<br>
Ike Auerbach, to his patent attorney at Burroughs
</blockquote>

<br>

<blockquote>This has more to do with the ethics of patent attorneys than
it has to do with patents.  The whole patent  system is a piece of
junk. It's really medieval stuff.
<br>
J. Presper Eckert
</blockquote>

<br>

<h3>World's Silliest Patents?</h3>

<ul>
  <li> Blinking cursor (#3,967,266)
  <li> Icons for "soft key" functions and menus on a cellular phone (#5,633,912)
</ul>
