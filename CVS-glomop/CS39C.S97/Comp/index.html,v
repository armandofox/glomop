The need for counting has always been with us: trade and barter, sizing
up the enemy's army, describing the size of a herd, economic planning (the
Egyptians had sophisticated harvesting timetables). This ubiquitous need
led to the Sumerian counting tablet using small stones (<I>calculi</I>),
the Chinese <A HREF="http://www.qi-journal.com/abacus.html">abacus</A>,
and numeration systems (<B>Scavenger hunt:</B> who invented the zero?).
Social and economic development after the Dark Ages brought the need for
more complicated and time-consuming computations: multiplication and division,
raising to powers, taking roots. Inventors responded with the logarithms,
Napier's Bones, and the slide rule (an early analog computer); and with
various mechanical calculating machines, culminating in the dazzlingly
complex designs of the eccentric genius Charles Babbage and his protege
Ada Lovelace. Babbage's insight, inspired by Jacquard's punch-card-controlled
weaving loom, was that machines could be made to perform an <I>arbitrary</I>
sequence of manipulations of numerical quantities: the genesis of the <I>stored
program</I> concept.

of Mechanical Computers (1890-1940)</H3>
<A HREF="http://www.computer-museum.org/collections/hollerith.html"><IMG SRC="hollpunch.gif"  ALIGN=RIGHT></A>
The U.S. of the late 1800's was the world's industrial and economic leader,
with a laissez-faire capitalist ambience that encouraged an unprecedented
wave of innovation and invention....and a population exploding so rapidly
that census tabulation could barely be finished in time for the next census.
It was in this atmosphere that the energetic and entrepreneurial <A HREF="http://www.invent.org/book/book-text/57.html">Herman
Hollerith</A> patented his punch-card reader and tabulating machine, which
the U.S. Government used for the 1890 and 1900 censuses and which made
Hollerith a millionaire. (<B>Scavenger hunt:</B> What year was the last
U.S. Census to use punch-card technology, and what replaced the punch cards
after that?)

<P>Meanwhile, German inventor Konrad Zuse made notable improvements to
mechanical calculators (incorporation of Boole's binary logic, programmability
using paper tapes), but they were eclipsed by&nbsp;<A HREF="http://www.arts.ucsb.edu:80/HAC/his.comp/1900-1929/1925.html"><IMG SRC="diff_anlz.gif"  ALIGN=LEFT></A>two
huge machines: the Differential Analyzer, built by Vannevar Bush and his
colleagues at MIT and operational by 1925, and the Mark I, built at Harvard
and IBM under the direction of Howard Aiken. Both were paragons of electromechanical
computing---and technological dead ends. For in heartland Iowa and Philadelphia,
the ideas behind the nearest predecessor to today's electronic computer
were already being developed. The inventors would deliver to the military
the next-generation electronic computer and launch a new industry, only
to be overtaken, ironically, by the descendant of Hollerith's CTR Company:
<A HREF="http://www.ibm.com/">IBM</A>.

ENIAC and UNIVAC: The Computer Is Born (1940-1955)</H3>
<A HREF="http://www.library.upenn.edu/special/gallery/mauchly/jwmintro.html"><IMG SRC="eniac.jpg"  ALIGN=LEFT></A>By
1937, America's eventual involvement in World War II seemed inevitable.
But Bush's Differential Analyzer took nearly a month to compute complete
ballistic trajectory tables; so the Army, desperate for faster computers,
awarded a contract in 1943 to the University of Pennsylvania. At Penn's
Moore School of Engineering, recent faculty hire John Mauchly and 21-year-old
graduate student J. Presper Eckert had proposed a high-speed vacuum-tube
calculating machine. Working against the opinion of the nation's most influential
researchers and military strategists, Eckert and Mauchly's team produced
ENIAC (Electronic Numerical Integrator And Calculator), the first general-purpose
electronic digital computer, ushering in the computer age.&nbsp;<A HREF="http://www.tcm.org/history/timeline/detail/1951-univac.html"><IMG SRC="univac_small.gif" HEIGHT=72 WIDTH=80 ALIGN=RIGHT></A>
Little did they know that the short-lived Eckert-Mauchly Computer Company,
which begat UNIVAC (the first commercial general-purpose electronic computer),
would be quickly absorbed into the most bitter and protracted patent feud
in computer history. At issue: Mauchly's conversations with John Vincent
Atanasoff, an Iowa State professor who had been playing with vacuum-tube
binary circuits; engineering dean Paul Brainerd's ideas about patent policies
for Moore School research; and the unofficial early "evangelism" publication
describing stored-program computers by brilliant and flamboyant mathematician
John von Neumann.

</A>UNIVAC may have been the first commercial computer, but by the early
1960's IBM's hegemony in business computers was undisputed. (<I>Personal</I>
computer? What's that?) A number of companies made a living off the crumbs,
building accessories that worked with IBM's equipment; but IBM quickly
became the undisputed leader in business computer sales. IBM's success
was due to its legendary sales force and the influence and leadership of
Thomas J. Watson Jr., who inherited presidency of the company from his
father in 1952 and whose innate grasp of computers (he was, after all,
of the "ENIAC generation") provided his vision for IBM's future, with his
father's grudging consent.

<P>&nbsp;But all that was about to change. The 1947 invention of the solid-state
transistor by Bardeen, Brattain, and Shockley at AT&amp;T Bell Labs, a
tremendous improvement over the vacuum tube, had already made computers
cheaper, smaller, faster and more reliable. But the brainchild of two inventors
working independently, Jack Kilby and Bob Noyce, was about to take the
game to a whole new level: the <I>integrated circuit</I> combined both
transistorized computer logic and "glue" circuitry on a single silicon
chip.

Not Just for Number Crunching Anymore (1955-1970)</H3>
As computers became more powerful, people began to think of new ways of
using them, completely unlike the "number crunching" for which they were
originally intended. Steve Russell, a graduate student at MIT, demonstrated
the archetype of all video games, Spacewar, in 1962.&nbsp;<A HREF="http://www.cs.orst.edu/~crowl/history/"><IMG SRC="spacewar.jpg"  ALIGN=RIGHT></A>
Doug Engelbart invented the mouse in 1964 at <A HREF="http://parc.xerox.com">Xerox
PARC</A>, just one year after Ivan Sutherland had demonstrated Sketchpad,
the first use of computer graphics. Admiral Grace Murray Hopper built the
first compiler for a computer programming language, allowing programmers
to concentrate their programming effort on the problem being solved rather
than arcane machine details; the rapid development of languages like BASIC,
FORTRAN and COBOL allowed programming to evolve into a discipline as rich
and complex in its own right as computer design, and sparked renewed interest
in the theoretical analysis of algorithms and computability, based on the
pioneering theoretical work of the genius Alan Turing. In 1968, the NATO
Science Committee Conference coined the term <I>software engineering</I>
and the new field was officially born.

"A Computer On Every Desktop": Computing for the Masses (1970-1980)</H3>
A quiet revolution had been brewing since the invention of the solid state
transistor at Bell Labs in 1947 and the subsequent invention of the <I>integrated
circuit</I> by Bob Noyce and Jack Kilby, working independently and at separate
companies. Cheaper, less power-hungry, and more reliable than its primitive
ancestor the vacuum tube, the IC transformed the landscape for computer
design. Engineer and entrepreneur Ken Olsen seized the opportunity early,
and built the hugely successful Digital Equipment Corp. around <I>minicomputers</I>
that even modest businesses could afford. (The fabulously successful PDP-8
is the machine on which the UNIX operating system was born, and its successor
the VAX had sold more units than any machine in history until the IBM PC.)
(??) But what really turned the tide at Noyce's newly-formed Intel (for
<B>int</B>egrated <B>el</B>ectronics)was Ted Hoff's invention of the <I>microprocessor</I>,
essentially a complete computer on a single chip ("just add memory"). Now,
anyone with a few dollars could buy a microprocessor and build a small
computer. And build they did: when Steve Wozniak showed off his contraption
to the now-legendary Homebrew Computer Club in Silicon Valley, his entrepreneurial
partner Steve Jobs knew they had a winner. The Apple II was not the world's
first microcomputer, but with software wizards Dan Bricklin and Bob Frankston's
revolutionary program VisiCalc, the Apple II was the first to enjoy success
because of a <I>Killer App</I>. The writing was on the wall: "None will
survive the attack of the killer micros!"

<h1>The Extremely Condensed History of Computing</h1>

<a name="1">
<h3>"It Weaves Algebraic Patterns": Abacuses, Looms, and Arithmetic
Engines (c.3000 B.C. to c.1870)</h3> 

<a href="http://www.qi-journal.com/abacus.html"> <img align="right"
src="gifs/abacus.gif"></a> The need for counting has always been with
us: trade and barter, sizing up the enemy's army, describing the size of
a herd, economic planning (the Egyptians had sophisticated harvesting
timetables).  This ubiquitous need led to the Sumerian counting tablet
using small stones (<i>calculi</i>), the Chinese <a
href="http://www.qi-journal.com/abacus.html">abacus</a>, and numeration
systems (<b>Scavenger hunt:</b> who invented the zero?).  Social and
economic development after the Dark Ages brought the need for more
complicated and time-consuming computations: multiplication and
division, raising to powers, taking roots.  Inventors responded with the
logarithms, Napier's Bones, and the slide rule (an early analog
computer); and with various mechanical calculating machines, culminating
in the dazzlingly complex designs of the eccentric genius Charles
Babbage and his protege Ada Lovelace.  Babbage's insight, inspired by
Jacquard's punch-card-controlled weaving loom, was that machines could
be made to perform an <i>arbitrary</i> sequence of manipulations of
numerical quantities: the genesis of the <i>stored program</i> concept.

<h3>The <a href="http://nqcd.lanl.gov/WEBSTER?apotheosis">Apotheosis</a>
of Mechanical Computers (1890-1940)</h3> 

<a href="http://www.computer-museum.org/collections/hollerith.html"><img
src="gifs/hollpunch.gif" align="right"></a> The U.S. of the late 1800's
was the world's industrial and economic leader, with a laissez-faire
capitalist ambience that encouraged an unprecedented wave of innovation
and invention....and a population exploding so rapidly that census
tabulation could barely be finished in time for the next census.  It was
in this atmosphere that the energetic and entrepreneurial <a
href="http://www.invent.org/book/book-text/57.html">Herman Hollerith</a>
patented his punch-card reader and tabulating machine, which the
U.S. Government used for the 1890 and 1900 censuses and which made
Hollerith a millionaire.  (<b>Scavenger hunt:</b> What year was the last
U.S. Census to use punch-card technology, and what replaced the punch
cards after that?)  <br clear="left"> <br>Meanwhile, German inventor
Konrad Zuse made notable 
improvements to mechanical calculators (incorporation of Boole's binary
logic, programmability using paper tapes), but they were eclipsed by
<A
HREF="http://www.arts.ucsb.edu:80/HAC/his.comp/1900-1929/1925.html"><img
align="left" src="gifs/diff_anlz.gif"></a>two
huge machines: the Differential Analyzer, built by
Vannevar Bush and his colleagues at MIT and operational by 1925, and the
Mark I, built at Harvard and IBM under the direction of Howard Aiken.
Both were paragons of electromechanical computing---and technological
dead ends.  For in heartland Iowa and Philadelphia, the ideas
behind the nearest predecessor to today's electronic computer were
already  being
developed.  The inventors would deliver to the military the
next-generation electronic computer and launch a new industry, only to
be overtaken, ironically, by the descendant of Hollerith's CTR Company:

<h3>ENIAC and UNIVAC: The Computer Is Born (1940-1955)</h3>

<a href="http://www.library.upenn.edu/special/gallery/mauchly/jwmintro.html">
<img align="left" src="gifs/eniac.jpg"></a>By 1937, America's eventual
involvement in World War II seemed 
inevitable.  But Bush's Differential Analyzer took nearly a month to
compute complete ballistic trajectory tables; so the Army, desperate for
faster computers, awarded a contract in 1943 to the University of
Pennsylvania.  At Penn's Moore School of Engineering, recent
faculty hire John Mauchly and 21-year-old graduate student J. Presper
Eckert had proposed a high-speed vacuum-tube calculating machine.
Working against the opinion of the nation's most influential researchers
and military strategists, Eckert and Mauchly's team produced ENIAC
(Electronic Numerical Integrator And Calculator), the first
general-purpose electronic digital computer, ushering in the computer
age.  <a href="http://www.tcm.org/history/timeline/1951/1951.html"><img
align="right" src="gifs/univac_small.gif"></a> Little did they know that
the short-lived Eckert-Mauchly Computer Company, which begat UNIVAC (the
first commercial general-purpose electronic computer), would be quickly
absorbed into the most bitter and protracted patent feud in computer
history.  At issue: Mauchly's conversations with John Vincent Atanasoff,
an Iowa State professor who had been playing with vacuum-tube binary
circuits; engineering dean Paul Brainerd's ideas about patent policies
for Moore School research; and the unofficial early "evangelism"
publication describing stored-program computers by brilliant and
flamboyant mathematician John von Neumann.<p>

<h3>IBM and the Seven Dwarfs (1955-1970)</h3>

</a>
UNIVAC may have been the first commercial computer, but by the early
1960's IBM's hegemony in business computers was undisputed.
(<i>Personal</i> computer?  What's that?)  A number of companies made a
living off the crumbs, building accessories that worked with IBM's
equipment; but IBM quickly became the undisputed leader in business
computer sales.  IBM's success was due to its legendary sales force and the
influence and leadership of Thomas
J. Watson Jr., who inherited presidency of the company from his father
in 1952 and whose innate grasp of computers (he was, after all, of the
"ENIAC generation") provided his vision for IBM's future, with his
father's grudging consent.<p>
But all that was about to change.  The 1947 invention
of the solid-state transistor
by Bardeen, Brattain, and Shockley at AT&amp;T
Bell Labs, a tremendous improvement over the vacuum tube, had already
made computers cheaper, smaller, faster and more reliable.  But the
brainchild of two inventors working independently, Jack Kilby and Bob
Noyce, was about to take the game to a whole new level: the
<i>integrated circuit</i> combined both transistorized computer logic
and "glue" circuitry on a single silicon chip.

graphics.  Admiral Grace Murray Hopper built the first compiler for a
computer programming language, allowing programmers to concentrate their
programming effort on the problem being solved rather than arcane
machine details; the rapid development of languages like BASIC, FORTRAN
and COBOL allowed programming to evolve into a discipline as rich and
complex in its own right as computer design, and sparked renewed
interest in the theoretical analysis of algorithms and computability,
based on the pioneering theoretical work of the genius Alan Turing.  In
1968, the NATO Science Committee Conference coined the term <i>software
engineering</i> and the new field was officially born.

<h3>"A Computer On Every Desktop": Computing for the Masses (1970-1980)</h3>

A quiet revolution had been brewing since the invention of the solid
state transistor at Bell Labs in 1947 and the subsequent invention of
the <i>integrated circuit</i> by Bob Noyce and Jack Kilby, working
independently and at separate companies.  Cheaper, less power-hungry,
and more reliable than its primitive ancestor the vacuum tube, the IC
transformed the landscape for computer design. Engineer and entrepreneur
Ken Olsen seized the opportunity early, and built the hugely successful Digital
Equipment Corp. around <i>minicomputers</i> that even modest businesses
could afford.  (The fabulously successful PDP-8 is the machine on which
the UNIX operating system was born, and its successor the VAX had sold
more units than any machine in history until the IBM PC.) (??)  But what
really turned the tide at Noyce's newly-formed Intel (for
<b>int</b>egrated <b>el</b>ectronics)was Ted Hoff's invention of the
<i>microprocessor</i>, essentially a complete computer on a single chip
("just add memory").  Now, anyone with a few dollars could buy a
microprocessor and build a small computer.  And build they did: when
Steve Wozniak showed off his contraption to the now-legendary Homebrew
Computer Club in Silicon Valley, his entrepreneurial partner Steve Jobs
knew they had a winner.  The Apple II was not the world's first
microcomputer, but with software wizards Dan Bricklin and Bob
Frankston's revolutionary program VisiCalc, the Apple II was the first
to enjoy success because of a <i>Killer App</i>.  The writing was on the
wall:  "None will survive the attack of the killer micros!"

possible the first truly affordable "minicomputer", Ken Olsen's fabulously

bitter patent dispute, Bob Noyce and his associates would use the IC

The U.S. of the late 1800's was the world's industrial and economic
leader, with a laissez-faire capitalist ambience that encouraged an
unprecedented wave of innovation and invention....and a population
exploding so rapidly that census tabulation could barely be finished in
time for the next census.  It was in this atmosphere that the energetic
and entrepreneurial
<a href="http://www.invent.org/book/book-text/57.html">Herman
Hollerith</a> patented his punch-card reader and
tabulating machine, which the U.S. Government used for the 1890 and 1900
censuses and which made  Hollerith a millionaire.  (<b>Scavenger
hunt:</b> What year was the last U.S. Census to use punch-card
technology, and what replaced the punch cards after that?)

pivotal: Konrad Zuse's machines could be programmed using paper tapes,

invented by George Boole in 1854.  Unfortunately for Zuse, another
machine stole the show: the Mark I, built at Harvard and IBM under the
direction of Howard Aiken, the ultimate mechanical
computer...and a technological dead end.  For in heartland Iowa and
eastern Pennsylvania, the ideas behind the nearest predecessor to today's
electronic computer were being developed.   The inventors would
deliver to the military the next-generation electronic computer and
launch a new industry, only to be overtaken by the company that would
become synonymous with computers, the descendant of Hollerith's

<h3>ENIAC and Univac: The Computer Is Born (1940-1955)</h3>

By 1937, America's eventual involvement in World War II seemed
inevitable.  But the fastest available computing device, the analog
Differential Analyzer invented by MIT's visionary Vannevar Bush, took
nearly a month to compute ballistic trajectory tables; so the Army,
desperate for faster computers, awarded a contract in 1943 to the
University of Pennsylvania's Moore School of Engineering, where
little-known recent faculty hire John Mauchly and 21-year-old lab
assistant J. Presper Eckert had proposed a high-speed vacuum-tube
calculating machine.  Working against the opinion of the nation's most
influential researchers and military strategists, Eckert and Mauchly's
team produced ENIAC (Electronic Numerical Integrator And Calculator),
the first general-purpose electronic digital computer, ushering in the
computer age.  Little did they know that the Eckert-Mauchly Computer
Company would become the patriarch of a family tree marred by the most
bitter and protracted patent feud in computer history.  At issue:
Mauchly's conversations with John Vincent Atanasoff, an Iowa State
professor who had been playing with vacuum-tube binary circuits;
engineering dean Paul
Brainerd's ideas about patent
policies for Moore School research; and the unofficial early "evangelism"

The need for counting has always been with us: trade and barter, sizing
up the enemy's army, 
describing the size of a herd, economic planning (the
Egyptians had sophisticated harvesting timetables).  This ubiquitous
need led to the Sumerian
counting tablet using small stones (<i>calculi</i>),
the Chinese <a href="http://www.qi-journal.com/abacus.html">abacus</a>,
and numeration systems (who invented the zero?).  Social and economic
development after the Dark Ages brought the need for more complicated
and time-consuming computations: multiplication and division, raising to
powers, taking roots.  Inventors responded with the logarithms, Napier's
Bones, and the slide rule (an early analog computer); and with various
mechanical calculating machines, culminating in the dazzlingly complex
designs of the eccentric genius Charles Babbage and his protege Ada Lovelace.
Babbage's insight, inspired by Jacquard's punch-card-controlled weaving
loom, was that machines could be made to perform an <i>arbitrary</i>
sequence of manipulations of numerical quantities: the genesis of the
<i>stored program</i> concept.  <p>
