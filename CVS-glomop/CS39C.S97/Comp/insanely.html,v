<title>Insanely Great and The Big Shrink</title>
</head>

<body>
<h1>Discussion: Insanely Great</h1>

<ul>
  <li> Jobs the evangelist
       <ul>
         <li> Hare Krishna member in Portland
         <li> traipsed around India during leave of absence from Atari,
              searching for spiritual leader Neem Karoli
         <li> How he lured Scully from Pepsi
         <li> Was Jobs too preoccupied with "elegant technology"?  What
              else has he done since leaving Apple, and what happened to
              it?  How was it financed?
         <li> Kawasaki's later book, <i>Selling the Dream</i>
         <li> "1984" commercial
       </ul>
  <li> Chutzpah
       <ul>
         <li> Steven Levy couldn't get inside interviews or previews of
              Mac and its team, unless he agreed to get them on <i>the
              cover</i> of <i>Rolling Stone</i>!
       </ul>
  <li> Technical history of the Mac: Xerox PARC
       <ul>
         <li> A nirvana for researchers?
         <li> Alan Kay and the PARC guys
              <ul>
                <li> original desktop concept, including pop-up and
                     pull-down menus
                <li> original "modeless" concept
                <li> original "noun-verb" action concept
              </ul>
         <li> What other inventions came out of Xerox PARC?  What did
              Xerox do with them?
         <li> Did Xerox get anything from Apple's "theft" of the Alto
              interface?  Should they have?
         <li> Who was funding the project  under which Engelbart (at
              SRI, before going to PARC)
              developed the concept of windows, and invented the mouse
              to help navigate them?
       </ul>
  <li> Why did  PARC  drop the ball?
       <ul>
         <li> Pure researchers
         <li> Disdain for Homebrew Computer Club, meeting just a few
              miles away.  Didn't see the connection.
              
       </ul>
  <li> Research with vision
       <ul>
         <li> The first thing to appear on Alto's screen: Cookie Monster
         <li> The personal computer was really personal!  The medium was
              the message--the computer was "for the rest of us"
         <li> It was the desktop <i>metaphor</i> the took the computer
              to the next stage of being useful, approachable, "user
              friendly".  (What software product did this, on the Apple II?)
       </ul>
  <li> What ultimately was the killer app for the Mac?
       <ul>
         <li> Does it seem
              unusual to you that, cool as it was, few people were
              buying the Mac
              until the killer app emerged?
         <li> Does this apply to the Internet?  How long has the
              Internet been around?  What is the killer app?
       </ul>              
</ul>

<h1>Discussion: The Big Shrink</h1>

<ul>
  <li> "The world has arrived at an age of cheap and complex devices of
       great reliability; and something is bound to come of it."
       --Vannevar Bush.
  <li> Adam Osborne and the Osborne I
       <ul>
         <li> Wanted to bring portable computers "to the people".  Who
              built the prototype?  Lee Felsenstein!
         <li> Osborne I specs: 24 pounds, 64K RAM, $1795 (a bargain at
              the time)
         <li> "...the moment we started to do really well,
              the...three-piece-pin-stripe-suited vultures all started
              to come in.  And they started to rape the initial
              entrepreneurs, one at a time.  I got raped, very simply,
              but I also got a hell of a good education in the process,
              and it won't happen again."
         <li> August 1981: first product announcement.  Sept. 1983:
              bankruptcy declared.  Hyper-growth.
       </ul>
  <li> What technologies and trends have been critical in bringing smaller
       computers to the masses?
       <ul>
         <li> Moore's law, both CPU and chips
         <li> Flat panel display
         <li> Better batteries
         <li> Denser disk drives (floppy and hard)
         <li> Software technology: apps that make it worthwhile to lug
              your computer around
         <li> Mass market acceptance
       </ul>
  <li> What about for things like cell phones?
       <ul>
         <li> Infrastructure
         <li> Consumer-level pricing
         <li> "Network effect": the more people have it....
         <li> Moore's law!
       </ul>
