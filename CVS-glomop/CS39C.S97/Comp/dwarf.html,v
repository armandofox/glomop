<h1>IBM and the Seven Dwarfs</h1>

The period in the computer industry from the mid 1950's till the late
1960's is often characterized as being dominated by "IBM and the seven
dwarfs" -- seven computer companies that tried valiantly to compete with
monolithic IBM for control of some chunk of the business computing
market.  Shortly after entering the market in the early fifties, IBM had
become its undisputed colossus, largely under the leadership and vision
of one man, Thomas J. Watson Sr.<p>

Although we won't examine the histories of all of them in detail, here
are the dramatis personae, in order of business computer market share as
of 1965:

<ol>
  <li> IBM: 65.3%
  <li> Sperry Rand (formerly Remington Rand): 12.1%
  <li> Control Data Corp.: 5.4%
  <li> Honeywell (formerly a division of Raytheon): 3.8%
  <li> Burroughs: 3.5%
  <li> General Electric: 3.4%
  <li> RCA: 2.9%
  <li> NCR (National Cash Register): 2.9%
  <li> The oft-forgotten eighth dwarf, Philco: 0.7%
</ol>

<h1>EMCC, BINAC, and UNIVAC</h1>

Shortly after ENIAC, Eckert and Mauchly incorporated the Eckert-Mauchly
Computer Company (EMCC) to commercialize the technology.  EMCC would
participate in a series of mergers, restructurings, botched contracts,
and would ultimately end up the big loser in the field its founders
pioneered.<p>

EMCC got their first contract from NBS, the National Bureau of
Standards, to build another computer, a commercial improvement over
ENIAC, for the Census Bureau.  Perhaps amazingly, or due to the workings
of the "old boy" network, only two companies got to submit bids: EMCC
and Raytheon.  EMCC's was by far the lower bid, so they got the
contract.  Unfortunately, the contract had terms that were completely
unrealistic: a flat fee contract for an amount less than their own
interrnal estimate of developmenet costs; and an offer for EMCC to
absorb the loss itself if they didn't come in under ebudget, assuming
such a loss would be worth it if it got the new company off the ground.
In contrast, in another NBS-funded project, Raytheon was awarded the
contract and insisted on a cost-plus arrangement (NBS would pay the cost
of development to within a reasonable estimate, plus a reasonable profit
for the manufacturer).<p>

Eckert and Mauchly were familiar with such contracts, but they were
obsessed with securing a first customer for their new company, and
Eckert was nervous about losing patent rights: under cost-plus
contracts, some fraction of the patent rights typically go to the
contract grantor, whereas under flat-fee, <i>all</i> patent rights go
the developer.  The patent experience with Pender and von Neumann had
left a bitter taste for Eckert and he didn't want it repeated.<p>

Furthermore, despite NBS's efforts to encourage the new company, under
the standard contract guidelines the contract money could not be paid
until certain development checkpoints were demontsrated, so EMCC had to
come up with advance cash on its own.  To make things worse, an
evaluation report from "National Research Council Subcommittee Z on
High-Speed Computing" (which included such influential researchers as
Vannevar Bush) was dismissive of EMCC's commercial efforts,
causing other NBS agencies to proceed more slowly in contracting with
EMCC for their machines.<p>

Short of cash, EMCC was saved at the eleventh hour (in 1947) by landing
a small contract with Northrop Aircraft, to build a guidance computer
for Northrop's top-secret Snark guided missile.  This contract included
some badly needed up-front cash.  BINAC was delivered late, it was over
budget, it was sloppily
constructed, and there is some debate as to whether it ever worked
correctly at all.  (<b>Trivia fact:</b> Grace Murray Hopper, later a
Navy Admiral and the author of the first compiler, was one of the lead
programmers for BINAC.)<p>

Ike Auerbach, longtime engineering colleague and member of the
"executive committee" (such as it was) of EMCC, proposed that he and a
few engineers go "off to one side" to build inexpensive BINAC-like
machines to sell to universities, to generate capital so work on UNIVAC
could continue.  But Eckert would have none of it; he wanted to continue
UNIVAC without further distraction or dissent.  This may not have been
the best business decision ever made.  Shortly thereafter,
Auerbach left to join Burroughs, another "dwarf".  <p>

Several other companies put up some cash as potential UNIVAC customers,
including Prudential Insurance, A.C. Nielsen Company (as in the Nielsen
TV ratings).  After renewing its contract several times, Nielsen became
convinced that Eckert and Mauchly were brilliant computer designers who
didn't know how to run a business, and it made a reasonably generous
offer to buy EMCC.  EMCC turned down the offer, but when one of EMCC's
"angel investors" was killed in a plane crash, they were stuck---there
just wasn't enough cash to get going on the contracts they already had
pending.<p>

The end result was that EMCC was bought by Remington Rand, and it was
bought in a buyer's market: EMCC was running out of money and still
having trouble paying its bills.  Eckert and Mauchly sold their patent
rights for a fixed price of $70,000 plus guaranteed salaries of $18,000
per year for the next eight years; again, probably not the best decision
they could have made.  "I have had very bad experiences with [patent]
lawyers over the years", wrote Eckert in retrospect.  In 1951 the first
UNIVAC-I was finally delivered to the Census Bureau under the Remington
Rand brand name, and was so successful that <i>UNIVAC</i> practically
became a synonym for <i>computer</i>, much as <i>Xerox</i> would later
become a synonym for <i>copier</i>.  Its celebrity was cemented when
UNIVAC made a special appearance on CBS-TV, to predict the outcome of
the 1952 presidential election based on previous results.  <p>
(<b>Trivia:</b> It's a lesser-known fact that the money to purchase the
Census UNIVAC was really from the Army, but was channeled through the
Census Bureau.) 

Here was an opportunity for James Rand: IBM was dominant in the office
equipment field, but its leader Thomas Watson Sr. was unconvinced that
computers had a future.  But after the CBS broadcast, the sleeping giant
began to stir.

<h1>The First Dwarf and The Mergers Begin</h1>

In 1952, there was only one company you could buy a business computer
from: Remington Rand, selling the UNIVAC-I.  IBM leader Thomas Watson
Sr. had had a <a href="#note1">bad experience with Howard Aiken</a> and
the Mark I 
computer built jointly by Harvard and IBM, so it may be understandable
that he was not the biggest fan of electronic computing.  But son Thomas
Watson Jr. had long believed there would be a tremendous market for the
new technology, and he ordered IBM's legendary sales force, which had
claimed there were no customers for computers, to go find some.
Marketing had no idea how to price computer rentals (which was the
service model IBM had in mind; can you figure out why?), so they came up
with an initial estimate of $5,200 a month.  Amazingly, when they
revised the estimate to $22,000 a month late in the project, all of
their original customers agreed to take delivery for a compromise
$15,000 a month---nearly triple the original estimate.  Such was IBM's
brand name clout.<p>

The IBM 701 scientific computer, and its commercial counterpart the 702,
sold well despite their technological inferiority compared to 
UNIVAC.  It was the beginning of the end for Remington Rand, where
quarrels between Bill Norris in the St. Paul (Minnesota) office, Eckert
in the Philadelphia office,  and the New York
headquarters were starting to divide loyalties.  Eckert and his team
wanted to push the technology envelope;  Norris and his associates
wanted to build using contemporary, proven technology.  The regular
sales force knew little about computers, and even less about how
computers could help their business customers;  Remington had a team of
engineers to answer customer questions, but those people were rarely
familiar with how their customers did business and therefore how
computers could help them.  IBM, in contrast, had long ago mastered the
technique of training specialized salespeople who knew each customer's
business in detail.  It was no contest.<p>

In 1955 Remington Rand merged with Sperry to form Sperry-Rand.  The
UNIVAC engineers continued to be the best in the world, while the sales
force continued to be among the least effective; in his unauthorized
history of IBM, Robert Sobel speculates that Remington might have done
better to simply hire away some of IBM's star salespeople, given that
IBM was still building vacuum-tube machines when most companies had
begun producing machines based on the revolutionary transistor
technology that had been invented at Bell Labs in 1947.  By 1957 Bill
Norris had had enough, and he left Remington Rand with a few key UNIVAC
engineers to start his own company, Control Data Corp. (CDC).<p>

Despite IBM's technically unremarkable machines, their sales and
marketing expertise won them total dominance in just two years of an
industry they were almost too shortsighted to jump into and which would
transform the company.  By 1955 it was selling half of all business
computers in America.

<h1>CDC and FUD</h1>

Norris's Control Data was an upstart.  Norris's style had never made him
fit in well at Remington Rand.  CDC's strategy was to go after the
scientific and government laboratory market segment, which IBM was
largely ignoring; to that end, CDC announced that they were developing a
new kind of "supercomputer", the CDC 6600.  One of the engineers
designing this machine, Seymour Cray, would eventually go on to found
his own supercomputer company.<p>

The 6600 announcement worried IBM.  They responded in two ways.  First,
they began designing the 360/91, a machine they claimed would be
comparable to the 6600.  The second, and perhaps more insidious tactic,
was to make sure via extensive advertising and word of mouth that their
customers knew that "good old IBM" was working on an answer to the 6600.
IBM was instilling Fear, Uncertainty and Doubt about CDC into its
customers' minds.  But the 360/91 was still under development well after
the 6600 began shipping, and some people privately began to wonder
whether IBM planned to actually ship the 360/91 at all, or was just
using it as a ploy to discourage potential CDC customers.  As a result
of IBM sales efforts, Norris found himself cutting prices to battle a
computer that didn't even exist; in 1967, IBM abandoned plans to produce
the 360/91, agreeing to produce only those that had already been sold.
Norris was furious, and sued for antitrust violations in 1968, alleging
that IBM had damaged CDC's business by offering to sell products that
did not exist and that in fact the company had no intention of
producing.  IBM practically created its own law firm to defend it.  In
1973, after protracted proceedings, IBM agreed to sell its Service
Bureau Corporation (which handled servicing of computer customers) to
CDC, along with some accompanying customer contracts, and paid legal
fees and a cash settlement of $101 million to CDC.  IBM's condition for
settling was that the entire index of evidence used in the
proceedings---75,000 pages indexing the contents of over 120 million
documents---be completely destroyed, in the presence of IBM attorneys.
The Justice Department filed an injunction to prevent this, claiming
destruction of evidence.  The case dragged on until 1983, when the
Reagan administration dropped the last of the antitrust charges.<p>

<h1>Who Invented the Computer?  Honeywell v. Sperry Rand</h1>

The ugly specter of intellectual property law had seemingly gone
unnoticed during all of the IBM hullabaloo.  But it was waiting in the
wings.  Since Remington Rand had bought out Eckert and Mauchly's patent
rights for a pittance, IBM had been paying patent royalties to Remington
as its computer sales took off.  But the Remington lawyers claimed that
IBM's payments were not royalties, but rather damages resulting from
Remington's earlier patent suit against IBM, before the cross-licensing
had been worked out.  Eckert and Mauchly thus ended up with a total of
$300,000 over eight years for their patent rights, rather than the tens
of millions of dollars IBM would eventually pay Remington.<p>

But there was more.  The ENIAC patent had been assigned to Illinois
Scientific, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Remington Rand.  Illinois
Scientific promptly sued Honeywell (one of the dwarfs) for patent
infringement.  Honeywell countersued, claiming that the patent had been
issued after the statutory one-year period following the machine's
development and was therefore invalid.  Realizing that a successful
challenge to the ENIAC patent would change the entire patent landscape
of the computer industry, Atanasoff jumped into the act---according to
some sources, encouraged by IBM attorneys.  The case ultimately proved
disastrous for almost everyone involved, except the attorneys.  In 1973,
<i>Honeywell v. Sperry Rand</i> was officially settled as follows:
first, that ENIAC had indeed been put into public use more than one year
before the patent application was filed, thereby invalidating the
patent; second, that sufficient prior documentation existed to
substantiate the allegation that much of ENIAC was largely based on
"prior art" (a claim largely based on von Neumann's informal draft
description of the machine's computing model, which to U. Penn's dismay
had been publicly circulated without their knowledge, giving von Neumann
more credit than they thought he deserved), and therefore not
patentable; third, that the lawyers on all sides had behaved
extraordinarily badly; and fourth, that John Atanasoff was the legal
inventor of the electronic computer.  The bitterness of this last blow
would stay with John Mauchly till his death.

<h1>Postscript.</h1>

In 1982, Sperry Rand officially retired the UNIVAC name, replacing it
with Sperry on all their computers.  Shortly afterward, Sperry Rand was
absorbed by Unisys Corp.  <I>Sic transit gloria mundi.</i>
