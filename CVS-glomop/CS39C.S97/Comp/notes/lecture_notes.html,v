<title>Discussion Notes</title>
</head>

<body>
<h3>Introduction</h3>

<b>Visual aids: "which ones belong together"</b>
<ul>
  <li> Vacuum tube, transistor, IC
  <li> Grocery calc, electronic calc, PDA
  <li> PCMCIA modem, desktop 2400 modem, acoustic coupler
</ul>

<h2>Abacuses, Looms, Arithmetic Engines</h2>

<h3>Early computers</h3>

<b>Messages: Commerce and military as drivers for high volume and
sophistication of mathematical operations</b>
<ul>
  <li> Dark ages to renaissance: invention of logarithms and
       mech. calculators
  <li> 50s-60s: large US companies using electronic computers
  <li> 1850's: Babbage, ballistic trajectory calculation
  <li> 1940's, ENIAC: same thing!
</ul>

<h3>Counting and Arithmetic</h3>
<b>Message:</b>  Replace hard operations (multiplication) with easy
ones.  Need to count preceded need to compute; the latter was the driver
for numeration systems, etc
<ul>
  <li> Abacus: 3000 BC.  It helps you count.
  <li> Zero invented in 650AD?  Orient? India? Mesopotamia?  Either way,
       it was really important: it allows radix notation, which helps
       you <i>compute</i>.  You need that for commerce and military.
  <li> Example with Napier's bones: (message: use addition only)
  <li> Radix based vs. symbolic numeration: do addition/mult. in Roman,
       decimal, binary,  for some driving app (e.g. tax forms)
  <li> Overview question: digital vs. analog.  What was abacus?  Slide rule?
</ul>

<h3>Babbage, Ada, the Difference Engine and the Analytical Engine</h3>
<b>Message:</b> It takes more than genius
<ul>
  <li> Example of the Difference Engine (message: use addition only)
  <li> Other inventions: sound actuarial tables; cowcatchers; various
       tools needed to build his engines;
  <li> operations research (<i>On the
       economy of machinery and manufactures</i>): industry benefits
       from scientific approach
  <li> Did Govt get its money's worth?  Machines never got built, and
       Babbage's ideas never fully appreciated till 1940's!  But,
       <i>we</i> got the benefits...is this a dilemma for Govt funding today?
  <li> Ada: saw the potential for the A.E. to do arbitrary data
       abstraction.  As far ahead of her time as Babbage was ahead of
       his.  But a lady of her time, societally!
       <ul>
         <li> Subroutines
         <li> Loops
         <li> Arbitrary data abstraction: representing things as numbers
       </ul>
</ul>

<b>Message:</b> Computation is about conditional operations and
programmed sequences.
<ul>
  <li>The evolution of calculation into computation; the Difference
       Engine vs. the Analytical Engine.  Conditional ops.
  <li> Jacquard's punch card loom
  <li> Ada: the inventor of programming!  (subroutine, conditional jump)
  <li> Ada: "We may say most aptly that the Analytical Engine weaves
       algebraic patterns just as the Jacquard loom weaves flowers and
       leaves."
  <li> Married William King, Earl of Lovelace; but continued
       intellectual relationship with Babbage and translated Menabrea's 1842
       Italian description based on Babbage's talk; added notes in which
       she basically described the concepts of programming: variables,
       conditionals, the subroutine.
  <li> Dark side of Ada: compulsive gambler, became mistress of a
       no-good, died of uterine cancer at 36.
  <li> Visitor to Babbage during dying years explained how he got a tour
       of Babbage's workshop, along with B's explanation of why he had
       never finished any of the projects.
  <li> B had said he would happily die early if he could come back 500
       yrs later for just three days.  What if he came back now?
</ul>

<b>Meanwhile back on the farm:</b>

<ul>
  <li>Silicon discovered in 1823 at Bell Labs??
  <li>George Boole's <i>A Logic?? for Representing Thought</i>, 1854
  <li> Lead-in to societal issues:
       An apparently intellectual process (arithmetic) can be performed
       by a machine!
       Could people of Pascal's time have foreseen the implications?
</ul>


<b>Visual aids</b>
<ul>
  <li> Slide rule
  <li> Grocery calc: descendant of early mech. calculators
  <li> Abacus
  <li> Sliding pebbles
  <li> Sign "Computer" to hang on a person
</ul>

<h3>Apotheosis of Mechanical Computers</h3>

<B>Computer evolution</b>

<ul>
  <li> Last discussion: digital vs. analog.  Today: Stored-program
       vs. fixed-program computers, and automatic vs. manual; and their
       lineage  
       through the Analytical Engine.   <i>What
       is a modern computer?</i>
  <li> Where did punch card idea come from?  Similar ideas used today?
       (scoring standardized tests)
  <li> Dates on timeline (intervals) get shorter as time goes on!  Why?
</ul>

<B>Hollerith and the census</b>
<ul>
  <li> Hollerith's relnship with census board deteriorated: they thought
       it was costing MORE when overhead considered! Do we have this
       problem today?
  <li> When was the last time census was assisted by mechanical (punch
       card) device?  1950!  (Univac-1 delivered in 1951)
  <li> Why is Zuse less remembered?  Hollerith had entrepreneurial
       vision, markets in mind (foreign govts., insurance co's, etc).

As computers became more powerful, people began to think of new ways of
using them, completely unlike the "number crunching" for which they were
originally intended.  Steve Russell, a graduate student at MIT,
demonstrated the archetype of all video games, Pong, in 1962.  Doug
Engelbart invented the mouse in 1964 at <a
href="http://parc.xerox.com">Xerox PARC</a>, just one year after
Ivan Sutherland had demonstrated Sketchpad, the first use of computer
graphics.  The proliferation of computer <i>programming languages</i>
used for these tasks (BASIC, FORTRAN and COBOL, to name three of the
most popular) caused people to realize that programming computers was as
substantial a discipline as building them.  The design of programming
languages, programs, <i>algorithms</i> for solving problems, and the
<i>data structures</i> on which they operated, quickly became a field in
its own right, based on the theoretical work of the genius Alan
Turing, which in turn traced its roots back to George Boole's work in
the 1850's.  In 1968, the NATO Science Committee Conference coined the term
<i>software engineering</i> and the new field was officially born.

Although Univac was important because it was the first, by the early
1960's IBM's hegemony in business computers was undisputed.
(<i>Personal</i> computer?  What's that?)  A number of companies made a
living off the crumbs, building accessories that worked with IBM's
equipment.  IBM's success was largely the product of one man: Thomas
J. Watson Jr., who inherited presidency of the company from his father
in 1952 and whose innate grasp of computers (he was, after all, of the
"ENIAC generation") provided his vision for IBM's future, with his
father's grudging consent.<p>
But all that was about to change.  The 1947 invention
of the solid-state transistor by Bardeen, Brattain, and Shockley at AT&amp;T
Bell Labs, a tremendous improvement over the vacuum tube, had already
made computers cheaper, smaller, faster and more reliable.  But the
brainchild of two inventors working independently, Jack Kilby and Bob
Noyce, was about to take the game to a whole new level: the
<i>integrated circuit</i> combined both transistorized computer logic
and "glue" circuitry on a single silicon "chip".  The IC would make
possible the first truly affordable "minicomputer", Ken Olsen's fabulously
successful DEC PDP-8, and heralded the era of "garage
entrepreneurs" who would change the face of the industry.  Following a
bitter patent dispute, Bob Noyce and his associates would use the IC
concept to launch <a href="http://www.intel.com">Intel</a>,
still the world's most successful semiconductor
manufacturer.
