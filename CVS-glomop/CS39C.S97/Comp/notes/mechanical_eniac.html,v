<h1>Conversation Starters</h1>

<h3>What were some main ideas from last time?</h3>

<ul>
  <li> what motivates computer research?
       <ul>
         <li>Military needs
         <li> commerce (in Babbage's time); actuarial tables, etc
       </ul>
  <li> Babbage and his engines: why didn't he make a mass impact?
       <ul>
         <li> Personality
         <li> inability to schmooze
         <li> perfectionist and visionary, but not a hardheaded engineer
       </ul>
  <li> Ada, the first programmer, and what sets her apart
       <ul>
         <li> scientist, not engineer, but appreciated Babbage's work
         <li> "Women Computers": why weren't there any "male computers"?
       </ul>
  <li> Philosophical issues
       <ul>
         <li> Did the Government get its money's worth?
         <li> Who owned the technology?  Did it even matter for Babbage?
              Does it matter now?
       </ul>
</ul>

<h3>Digital, Analog, Automatic, Manual</h3>

Make a matrix and classify some devices:

<ul>
  <li> PC
  <li> Babbage's engines
  <li> Hollerith punch
  <li> Differential analyzer
  <li> Atanasoff-Berry Computer
  <li> ENIAC
  <li> Zuse calculators
  <li> Pocket calculator (or wristwatch calculator)
  <li> Bicycle tire pressure meter
</ul>

What distinctions does this taxonomy leave out?   Are the distinctions
important? 

<ul>
  <li>Electromechanical vs. electronic
       <ul>
         <li> Important: speed, reliability, durability/lifetime.  Have
              these things ultimately affected the impact of computers?
         <li> Unimportant: they can solve the same problems.  (We'll
              meet Turing machines next.)
       </ul>
  <li> General purpose vs. specific
       <ul>
         <li> Unimportant: can solve same problems
         <li> Important: general purpose far more useful
       </ul>
</ul>
       
<h3>ENIAC and its discontents</h3>

<ul>
  <li> Natl Defense Rsrch Committee: Vannevar Bush at head, created 1940
       to mobilize scientific community for WW2
  <li> "scientific elite", largely at MIT, the Diff. Anl. crowd
  <li> Stibitz: Bell Labs engineer, had experimented with
       electromechanical digital adding ckts
  <li> T.H. Johnson (Army rep at Aberdeen, one of the liaisons for
       military research at the Moore school) described proposal to Harold
       Hazen, one of Bush's MIT colleagues, who said "...How's for some
       bright ideas as to how to get Moore School profitably occupied."
</ul>

<ul>
  <li> What effect would you expect this discussion to have on the Moore
       School people?
  <li> Why was the NDRC so disdainful? Older crowd, accustomed to a
       particular technology, "those young
       upstarts" at Penn (many not even PhD's!)

</ul>

<h3>Misc</h3>

<ul>
  <li> Colossus: British codebreaking computer.  Next time, when we talk
       about Turing and software.
</ul>
