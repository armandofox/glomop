<title>The Apotheosis of Mechanical Computers</title>
</head>

<body>
<h1>Discussion: Mechanical Computers</h1>

<b>General</b>

<ul>
  <li> What does "apotheosis" mean?  What about in this context?
</ul>

<B>Computer evolution</b>

<ul>
  <li> Where did the punch card idea come from?  Is similar technology
       still used today?  Why?
  <li> Last week we talked about the <i>basic scientific</i> advances
       that led to electrical telegraphy and radio.  This week we're
       talking about people building machines.  Is this stuff just
       all engineering, or is there some science here?
</ul>

<B>Hollerith and the census</b>
<ul>
  <li> Hollerith's relationship with the Census Bureau deteriorated, since
       they thought the cost savings were illusory when the overhead of
       running the Hollerith machines was factored in!  Do we have this
       problem today?
  <li> How would you characterize Hollerith's personality, ambitions,
       and contribution to computer technology, compared to Babbage's or
       other people we've read about?
  <li> Hollerith ran a monopoly that the Government helped create.
       Later the Government would help break it up.  Sound familiar?
  <li> What did Hollerith do after the fairly successful adoption of his
       machines by the Census Bureau?
       <ul>
         <li> railroads; many engineering improvements; magnets (to
              close a ckt) instead of mercury cups; electrical adding
              machines instead of mechanical card coutners (note the
              lack of "not invented here" syndrome: practical!)
         <li> American Library Assoc.
         <li> For 1900 census, Tab. Machine bought out its mfg
              contractor, Taft-Peirce Co.
         <li> Changed business model: charge for the cards! (Who else
              does this?  Gillette, the phone company, the Franklin
              Planner people, IBM (later)
         <li> Census Bureau tried to break up his "monopoly" but
              ultimately failed; TM was too successful by then
              (reminiscent of Microsoft?)
         <li> Charles Randlett Flint: M&amp;A/investment specialist,
              liked TM's future, bought out for $450 a share.  Hollerith
              became an instant millionaire and retired.  Tom Watson,
              former salesman from NCR, brought in to run it;
              diversified its offerings and changed its name  to IBM.
       </ul>
  <li> Why is Konrad Zuse less remembered than Herman Hollerith?

</ul>

<b>Differential analyzer and Mark I</b>

<ul>
  <li> Background
       <ul>
         <li> Mark I: collaboration between IBM and Harvard; Prof Howard
              Aiken's idea (as part of his then-PhD work) to marry
              Babbage's "engines" to Hollerith's
              punched cards, to make an automatic calculator
         <li> Diff analyzer: solve differential eqs using a circuit
              technique called "integrators"; actually ended up being
              built mechanically.
       </ul>
  <li> How did they differ?
       <ul>
         <li> Automatic vs. manual (second version of Diff Anl was
              partly paper-tape-programmable)
         <li> Digital vs. analog: torque amplifiers, positions of
              rotating disks.  <i>What's the engineering problem with
              this?</i>                digital form but some of the 
         <li> Specific tasks to solve (diff. eqs vs generic arith calculations)
         <li> Mark I's legacy: Hollerith punch cards, Babbage's
              analytical engine
       </ul>
  <li> What was missing, relative to today's machines?
       <ul>
         <li> Electronic technology
         <li> General-purpose programmability; the ability to encode
              arbitrary symbols and operate on them.
       </ul>
  <li> What was on the horizon?
       <ul>
         <li> Electronics!  Faster, cheaper, better
         <li> Symbolic programming. Until now all had been "sequence
              programming", similar to simple HP calcs
       </ul>
</ul>

  <li> Digital vs. analog; automatic vs. manual.  Was the Differential
       Analyzer the last of the great analog computers?  Why would one
       build digital devices rather than analog ones?
