<title>ENIAC and UNIVAC</title>
</head>

<body>
<h1>Discussion: ENIAC and UNIVAC</h1>

<h3>Computer evolution</h3>
<ul>
  <li> Why do we think of ENIAC as the archetype of the modern
       electronic computer?  What did it have that its predecessors lacked
       (Hollerith's tabulator, Babbage's engines, Zuse's and Pascal's
       calculators)?
  <li> Why were MIT and the National Defense Research Consortium
       so disdainful of Eckert and Mauchly's electronic digital computer
       ideas?
</ul>

<h3>Intellectual Property Rears Its Ugly Head</h3>
<ul>
  <li> Who should get patent rights and royalties when a piece of
       academic research becomes commercially successful?  Here are some
       points to think about:
       <ul>
         <li> The University researchers may be public employees (in the
              case of public universities, like Berkeley).
         <li> Even at private nonprofit universities, the work is being
              funded by 
              Government grants, which come mostly from taxpayer dollars.
         <li> University researchers (and certainly graduate students!)
              usually earn less money and have a
              more austere lifestyle than corporate executives or
              industry lab researchers.
         <li> University research undertakes projects that most
              companies won't touch because they're not obviously
              commercially viable.  If not for the universities, nobody
              would do this.
       </ul>
  <li> Does the patent system do more harm than good?  That is, does it
       primarily protect and reward inventors while still allowing
       society to reap the benefits of their inventions, or does it
       enrich the wrong people and act as an obstacle to the creative
       process? 
  <li> Who invented the modern electronic digital computer?
       <ul>
         <li> John Vincent Atanasoff, who demonstrated the  earliest version
              of a totally electronic, vacuum-tube-based binary adder?
         <li> John von Neumann, who "evangelized" the stored-program
              computer concept to such a degree that to this day the
              model is known as the "von Neumann machine"?
         <li> J. Presper Eckert and John Mauchly, who built ENIAC and
              founded Univac, the first vendor of electronic
              general-purpose computers for business, based on the
              concept?
         <li> Charles Babbage and Ada Lovelace, whose machines and ideas
              clearly foreshadowed everything that was soon to come?
       </ul>
</ul>
