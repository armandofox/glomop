<h1>The Extremely Condensed History of Computing</h1>

<h3>"It Weaves Algebraic Patterns": Abacuses, Looms, and Arithmetic
Engines (c.3000 B.C. to c.1870)</h3> 

<a href="http://www.qi-journal.com/abacus.html">
<img align="right" src="gifs/abacus.gif"></a>
The need for counting has always been with us: trade and barter, sizing
up the enemy's army, 
describing the size of a herd, economic planning (the
Egyptians had sophisticated harvesting timetables).  This ubiquitous
need led to the Sumerian
counting tablet using small stones (<i>calculi</i>),
the Chinese <a href="http://www.qi-journal.com/abacus.html">abacus</a>,
and numeration systems (who invented the zero?).  Social and economic
development after the Dark Ages brought the need for more complicated
and time-consuming computations: multiplication and division, raising to
powers, taking roots.  Inventors responded with the logarithms, Napier's
Bones, and the slide rule (an early analog computer); and with various
mechanical calculating machines, culminating in the dazzlingly complex
designs of the eccentric genius Charles Babbage and his protege Ada Lovelace.
Babbage's insight, inspired by Jacquard's punch-card-controlled weaving
loom, was that machines could be made to perform an <i>arbitrary</i>
sequence of manipulations of numerical quantities: the genesis of the
<i>stored program</i> concept.  <p>

<h3>The <a href="http://nqcd.lanl.gov/WEBSTER?apotheosis">Apotheosis</a>
of Mechanical Computers (1890-1940)</h3> 

<a href="http://www.computer-museum.org/collections/hollerith.html"><img 
src="gifs/hollpunch.gif" align="right"></a>
The U.S. of the late 1800's was the world's industrial and economic
leader, with a laissez-faire capitalist ambience that encouraged an
unprecedented wave of innovation and invention....and a population
exploding so rapidly that census tabulation could barely be finished in
time for the next census.  It was in this atmosphere that the energetic
and entrepreneurial
<a href="http://www.invent.org/book/book-text/57.html">Herman
Hollerith</a> patented his punch-card reader and
tabulating machine, which the U.S. Government would use for the census
from 1890 until ??? and which made  Hollerith a millionaire.
<br clear="left">
Not long after, among the calculator builders improving on the
work of their nineteenth-century forefathers, we find one who would be
pivotal: Konrad Zuse's machines could be programmed using paper tapes,
and operated using the binary (base 2) number system and the logic
invented by George Boole in 1854.  Unfortunately for Zuse, another
machine stole the show: the Mark I, built at Harvard and IBM under the
direction of Howard Aiken, the ultimate mechanical
computer...and a technological dead end.  For in heartland Iowa and western
Pennsylvania ??, the ideas behind the nearest predecessor to today's
electronic computer were being developed.   The inventors would
deliver to the military the next-generation electronic computer and
launch a new industry, only to be overtaken by the company that would
become synonymous with computers, the descendant of Hollerith's
CTR Company: <a href="http://www.ibm.com/">IBM</a>.<p>

<h3>IBM and the Seven Dwarfs</h3>

Although Univac was important because it was the first, by the early
1960's IBM's hegemony in business computers was undisputed.
(<i>Personal</i> computer?  What's that?)  A number of companies made a
living off the crumbs, building accessories that worked with IBM's
equipment.  IBM's success was largely the product of one man: Thomas
J. Watson Jr., who inherited presidency of the company from his father
in 1952 and whose innate grasp of computers (he was, after all, of the
"ENIAC generation") provided his vision for IBM's future, with his
father's grudging consent.<p>
But all that was about to change.  The 1947 invention
of the solid-state transistor by Bardeen, Brattain, and Shockley at AT&amp;T
Bell Labs, a tremendous improvement over the vacuum tube, had already
made computers less expensive, smaller and more reliable.  But the
brainchild of two inventors working independently, Jack Kilby and Bob
Noyce, was about to take the game to a whole new level: the
<i>integrated circuit</i> combined both transistorized computer logic
and "glue" circuitry on a single silicon "chip".  The IC would make
possible the first truly affordable "minicomputer", Ken Olsen's fabulously
successful DEC PDP-8, and heralded the era of "garage
entrepreneurs" who would change the face of the industry.  Following a
bitter patent dispute, Bob Noyce and his associates would use the IC
concept to launch <a href="http://www.intel.com">Intel</a>,
still the world's most successful semiconductor
manufacturer.

<h3>Not Just for Number Crunching Anymore</h3>

As computers became more powerful, people began to think of new ways of
using them, completely unlike the "number crunching" for which they were
originally intended.  Steve Russell, a graduate student at MIT,
demonstrated the archetype of all video games, Pong, in 1962.  Doug
Engelbart invented the mouse in 1964, just one year after
Ivan Sutherland had demonstrated Sketchpad, the first use of computer
graphics.  The proliferation of computer <i>programming languages</i>
used for these tasks (BASIC, FORTRAN and COBOL, to name three of the
most popular) caused people to realize that programming computers was as
substantial a discipline as building them.  The design of programming
languages, programs, <i>algorithms</i> for solving problems, and the
<i>data structures</i> on which they operated, quickly became a field in
its own right, based on the earlier theoretical work of the genius Alan
Turing.  In 1968, the NATO Science Committee Conference coined the term
<i>software engineering</i> and the new field was officially born.
