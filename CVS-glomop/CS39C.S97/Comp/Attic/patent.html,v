<h1>The Patent System and Patent Attorneys</h1>

Here's what some prominent inventors have had to say about the patent
system, patent litigation, and patent attorneys.  Some things to think
about or investigate:
<ul>
  <li> What situations led these scientists and inventors to speak as
       they do?
  <li> Does the patent system do more harm than good?  That is, does it
       primarily protect and reward inventors while still allowing
       society to reap the benefits of their inventions, or does it
       enrich the wrong people and act as an obstacle to the creative
       process? 
</ul>

<blockquote>
Say I have lost all faith in patents, judges and everything related to
patents.  Don't care if the whole system is squelched.
</blockquote>

<br>
Thomas Edison
<br>

<blockquote>You have now filed the last patent you will ever file in my
name.  I will make claim to nothing, because what you are doing is
destroying a group that has the capability of producing great
things. You're divisive.
</blockquote>

<br>
Ike Auerbach, to his patent attorney at Burroughs
<br>

<blockquote>This has more to do with the ethics of patent attorneys than
it has to do with patents.  The whole patent  system is a piece of
junk. It's really medieval stuff.
</blockquote>

<br>
J. Presper Eckert
