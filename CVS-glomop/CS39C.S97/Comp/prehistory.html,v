<h1>Discussion: Prehistory through Babbage</h1>

<h3>Computer evolution</h3>
<ul>
  <li> What are computers used for now?
       <ul>
         <li> In the 1960's?
         <li> 1940's?
         <li> 1890's?
         <li> Earlier?
       </ul>
  <li> How has the usage evolved? Any trends?
       What factors do you think helped this evolution?
  <li> What motivations drove computer designers...
       <ul>
         <li> in Charles Babbage's time?
         <li> before World War II?
         <li> in the last few decades?
       </ul>
       The military?  Entrepreneurship?  Commerce?
</ul>

<h3>A Little About Counting and Arithmetic</h3>

<ul>
  <li> How much time separated the invention of the abacus and the
       adoption of the zero and radix notation?  
       Why was the zero so important?
  <li> Why were logarithms a cool invention?
  <li> How is a slide rule similar to Napier's bones?  to an abacus?
       How is it different?
</ul>

<h3>Babbage, Ada, the Difference Engine and the Analytical Engine</h3>
<ul>
  <li> What portrait of Babbage emerges from the readings?
  <li> Why weren't Babbage's designs successfully built?
  <li> Did the British Government get its grant money's worth?
  <li> We think of Ada as "the first programmer"; what does this really
       mean?  What accomplishments set her apart from Babbage?
</ul>

<b>Meanwhile, back on the farm...</b>

<ul>
  <li>George Boole's <i>An Investigation of the Laws of Thought</i>, 1854
</ul>

  <li> Where did the zero come from?  Why is it so important to be able
       to represent "nothing"?
  <li> When do you think Europeans switched from Roman numerals to
       Arabic numerals?
d35 2
a36 5
       <ul>
         <li> Hint: what makes multiplication worse than addition?
         <li> Is a slide rule a kind of computer?  How about Napier's Bones?
              a barometer?
       </ul>

  <li> What kind of portrait of Babbage emerges from the readings?
  <li> Why did Babbage have such a hard time completing his Engines?

<h3>Lead-In to Societal Issues</h3>

a50 4
  <li> An apparently intellectual process (arithmetic) can be performed
       by a machine!
       Could people of Pascal's time have foreseen the implications?
  <li> Who were the Luddites?
