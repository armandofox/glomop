@Strategy:

Want to use '*' not '&' for passing pointers to the Kerb routines.
When converting a CREDENTIALS or KTEXT_ST, etc. to an input, convert it
to (type *)NULL if the passed-in Sv doesn't look right; otherwise, cast
the passed-in Sv to (type), take the address, and use that as the input
value.

BE CAREFUL WITH the fd2p value - what's going on there?

Convention: if you pass 'undef' or an empty string, the kerberos routine
will receive a nullpointer.  if you pass soemthing that looks well
formed, the kerberos routine will receive a pointer to that thing.
