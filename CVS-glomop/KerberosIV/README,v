@This is KerberosIV for perl5.002.

Differences from KerberosIV library (libkrb.h) header:

- Constants defined as strings (KRB_MASTER, KRB_HOST, KRB_REALM,
  TKT_FILE, TKT_ROOT) are currently not exported

- A new function krb_strerror(errcode) translates a Kerberos return code
  into the error text

- Had to dummy-define flock() (better than linking -lucb)

- In the XS function glue, the following formal parameters were declared
  as type 'unsigned char *' rather than their original types in krb.h,
  to avoid an error whereby the resulting C code tries to cast a
  parameter to an array type.  Note that this means the original
  typedefs can be omitted from the typemap file.

  Original type                                 Type in XS function glue 
  -------------                                 ------------------------
  des_cblock (fixed array of unsigned char)     unsigned char * (T_PTROBJ)
  Key_schedule (array of structs each 
     containing fixed array of unsigned char)   unsigned char * (T_PTROBJ)

- compat-proto.h is a copy of the KerberosIV compat-proto.h file with
  the protos for 'warn' and 'warnx' ifdef'd out, since they conflict
  with something in perl.h.
