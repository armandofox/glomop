@Proofs of security for the Unix password hash
               David Wagner
      (Joint work with Ian Goldberg)
            TGIF, Friday Nov 20

I will present some new results on the exact
security of the Unix password hashing scheme.
To my knowledge, this is the first practical
proof of security for the 20-year-old Unix
hash function.

The main tool is a theoretical reduction to
the security of DES, a cryptographic primitive
widely believed to be secure.  As a corollary,
we show surprisingly tight lower bounds on the
security of an efficient construction of
one-way functions from block ciphers.
