@#ifndef __CALLBACK_H__

/* This is a workaround for a bug in the current version of gcc:

   gcc assumes that no one will touch %a4 after it is set up in crt0.o.
   This isn't true if a function is called as a callback by something
   that wasn't compiled by gcc (like FrmCloseAllForms()).  It may also
   not be true if it is used as a callback by something in a different
   shared library.

   We really want a function attribute "callback" which will insert this
   progloue and epilogoue automatically.
