@This is PCL - The Pilot Class Library
Preview release 0.0.1

Getting Started:
   1. Extract the distribution ;-)
   2. Read the documentation in doc/pl_index.html, especially the
        drawbacks concerning 'collect2' (please DO read it) on
        the main page.
   3. Go To one the samples/Basic directory and type 'make'. Follow the
        instructions, then type 'make' again.
   4. If everythings OK, read the documentation more thoroughly and try
        some more samples. (Be sure to read the PScrollbar class doc
        before trying samples/Scrollbar, the patch can be found in
        'pilrcScl.diff')
   5. If not, goto step 2.
   6. If not, again :-(

The samples:
   - samples/Basic is merely a test if the PCL is working at all.
   - samples/FormHandler is probably the most useful example. It shows
     the basic application structure as well as some subclassing methods.
   - samples/Fields and
   - samples/Scrollbar show the use of text fields w/ and w/o associated
     scrollbars.
 
Bug reports to johler@@ibm.net (But be sure you followed step 2.)
