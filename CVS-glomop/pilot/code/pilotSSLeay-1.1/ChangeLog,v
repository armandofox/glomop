@Changes since pilotSSLeay-1.0:

 o The libraries (both static and shared) now require much less of the
   Pilot's precious dynamic RAM.
 o The above change causes some libraries to take up more of the (read-only)
   memory for the text segment, so the test app, when linked statically,
   went over the 32K max code segment size.  Blowfish was removed from the
   default list of libs statically linked against the test app.
 o The shared libs were compiled with the most recent GLib package.
 o librsa_s.a was mistakenly not built in shlib/.  Fixed.
 o RSA_generate_key() had a bug if the BN library was shared (it tried to use
   BN_value_one).  Fixed.
