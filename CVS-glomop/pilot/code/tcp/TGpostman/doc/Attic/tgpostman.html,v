<h2><a name="intro">Introduction</a></h2>

<P>
Top Gun Postman is a POP3/APOP3 and SMTP capable mail dispatcher that runs
on the Palm Pilot Professional.  Top Gun Postman enables you to send mail
messages that you have composed offline, and retrieve mail messages that
are waiting for you in your POP3/APOP3 accessible mail spool.  Top Gun
Postman is <b><i>not</i></b> a complete mail package - it relies on the
built-in Mail program that is distributed with the Palm Pilot Pro for the
composition and viewing of messages.

<P> This release is a <b>beta</b> version of the program, which means that
although we believe we've eliminated most of the bugs, you may still run
across a few.  If so, please report them.

<h2><a name="new">What's New</a></h2>

Version 1.1 beta incorporates the following new features and bug-fixes:
<ul>
     <li> Top Gun Postman now handles the downloading of large messages
	  more gracefully.  If a message is too large, the entire messaage
	  will be downloaded, but only
	  as much of the message as can be put in an Inbox record is
	  saved.  This is usually between 20-24KB worth of data, but
	  sometimes as large as 32KB.  You will notice a &quot;message
	  truncated&quot; status indicator in the download progress screen
	  if this occurs.
	  <P>
     <li> A new button has been added to the main screen that sends SMTP
	  mail and receives POP mail in one fell swoop.
	  <P>
     <li> Top Gun Postman notices and obeys &quot;Status:&quot; headers.
	  If you select &quot;Save only unread messages&quot; in the POP
	  preferences screen, and if a downloaded message contains a Status
	  header with the &quot;R&quot; flag set (i.e. the message has
	  been read before), the message will not be
	  saved in your Inbox.
	  <P>
     <li> A potential memory leak was plugged.  This memory leak would only
	  be tickled if the server does not understand TOP, you have selected
	  &quot;Paste extra headers&quot;, and you have selected
	  &quot;Query for each message&quot;.
	  <i>(Bet you're wondering how we figured that one out, eh?)</i>
	  <P>
     <li> Your POP password is no longer displayed in the POP preferences
	  form.
	  <P>
     <li> &quot;X-Mailer&quot; and &quot;X-URL:&quot; headers are added to
	  outgoing messages.
	  <P>
     <li> Graffiti state indicators were added to the preferences forms.
</ul>

<h2><a name="insta">Downloading and Installing Top Gun Postman</a></h2>

<ol>
     <li> <a href="TGpostman-1.1.zip">Download TGpostman-1.1.zip</a>
	  and unzip the archive.
     <li> Install <b><code>TGpostman.prc</code></b> on your Pilot (using
	  Pilot Desktop on your Windows machine or pilot-xfer on your Unix
	  machine).
</ol>

You are now ready to configure Top Gun Postman.


<h2><a name="confi">Configuring Top Gun Postman</a></h2>

<ol>
     <li> Ensure that your Network and Modem preferences on your Pilot are
	  set correctly to establish a PPP connection.
     <li> Open the <b><code>TG Postman</code></b> application.  You should
	  see a screen that looks like this:
	  <center>
	  <img src="title.gif">
	  </center>
     <li> Tap on the <b><code>Menu</code></b> button to bring up the menus.
     <li> Tap on the <b><code>About</code></b> menu, and select
	  <b><code>About...</code></b>.  Enjoy our cool attribution and
	  the 1 bit photo of ourselves.
     <li> Tap on the <b><code>Menu</code></b> button, and select the
	  <b><code>SMTP Prefs...</code></b> item under the
	  <b><code>Options</code></b> menu.  You should see a screen that
	  looks like this:
	  <center>
	  <img src="smtpprefs.gif">
	  </center>
     <li> Enter the hostname or IP address of your SMTP server in the first
	  field.
     <li> Enter your email address in the second field.
     <li> Enter your real name in the third field.
     <li> Tap on the <b><code>Save</code></b> button.
     <li> Select the <b><code>Pop Prefs...</code></b> item under the
	  <b><code>Options</code></b> menu.  You should see a screen that
	  looks like this:
	  <center>
	  <img src="popprefs.gif">
	  </center>
     <li> Enter the hostname or IP address of your POP3 server in the first
	  field.
     <li> Enter your POP3 username in the second field.
     <li> Tap on the <b><code>Tap to enter</code></b> box to bring up the
	  password box, which looks like this:
	  <center>
	  <img src="poppass.gif">
	  </center>
     <li> Enter your POP3 password in the field, and tap on OK.
     <li> If you are using APOP, tap on the checkbox next to
	  <b><code>Use APOP</code></b>.
     <li> If you want to see headers other than <b><code>To:, From:, Cc:,
	  </code></b> and <b><code>Subject</code></b>, tap on the
	  checkbox next to
	  <b><code>Paste extra headers into body</code></b>.  These extra
	  headers
	  will appear at the beginning of the message.
     <li> If you want to automatically delete messages from the server
	  after downloading them, tap on the checkbox next to
	  <b><code>Delete messages from the server</code></b>.
     <li> If you want Top Gun Postman to not save any messages that you
	  have read before, tap on the checkbox next to <b><code>Save only
	  unread messages</code></b>.  This is useful in case you have lots
	  of previously viewed messages in your POP3 mailspool that you
	  don't want cluttering up your inbox.  Top Gun Postman detects
	  previously read messages by noting that the <b><code>R</code></b>
	  status flag is set in a <b><code>Status:</code></b> header.
     <li> If you want Top Gun Postman to query you for what to do before
	  downloading each message (giving you the opportunity to view the
	  headers for a message before downloading it), tap on the
	  checkbox next to <b><code>Query for each message</code></b>.
	  This is
	  useful in case people like sending you postscript or large MIME
	  inclusions by email.  If this option is selected as well as
	  <b><code>Save only unread messages</code></b>, you will NOT be
	  queried regarding previously read messages.
     <li> Tap on the <b><code>Save</code></b> button.
</ol>

You are now ready to use Top Gun Postman.

<h2>Using Top Gun Postman</h2>

<h3><a name="compo">Composing Mail</a></h3>

To compose mail, use the <b><code>Mail</code></b> application that is built
into the Palm Pilot Professional.  Your composed mail will be filed in your
<b><code>Outbox</code></b>, which is where Top Gun Postman will look for
messages to send.  If the very first line of your mail message is
## (on a line by itself), then all subsequent lines
until a completely blank line are treated as additional headers.

<h3><a name="sendi">Sending Mail</a></h3>

To send previously composed mail, launch <b><code>TG Postman</code></b> and
tap on the <b><code>Send mail</code></b> button.  Top Gun Postman will
attempt to start a PPP session (if one hasn't already been started), and
then will connect to the configured SMTP server and send your mail.  All
successfully sent mail messages will be refiled in the
<b><code>Filed</code></b> folder.

<h3><a name="recei">Receiving Mail</a></h3>

In order to receive new mail messages, launch <b><code>TG
Postman</code></b> and tap on the <b><code>Get mail</code></b> button.
Top Gun Postman will start a PPP session (if necessary), and then will
connect to the POP server.  Once authentication has succeeded, Top Gun
Postman will begin downloading messages.  You should notice a dialog box
that looks like the following while messages are being downloaded:
<center><img src="progress.gif"></center>
The &quot;Retrieving message X of Y&quot; indicator tells you how many
messages are in your POP mail spool, and the status bar below this
indicates the download progress of the current message.
<p>

If you have indicated that you want Top Gun Postman to query you for each
message, a dialog box will pop up after the header of each message is
downloaded; this dialog box contains two buttons and a checkbox as well as
the message headers and size, and should look like this:
<center><img src="disposition.gif"></center>
If your POP3 server does not support the
&quot;TOP&quot; command, you won't be able to preview the message headers,
and will only see the message size.  Toggle the <b><code>Delete
message</code></b> checkbox if you want the message to be deleted from the
server.  Then, tap on either the <b><code>Get Message</code></b> or the
<b><code>Skip Message</code></b> button depending on whether you want the
message to be retrieved or not.  Note: if you tap on <b><code>Skip
Message</code></b> and indicate that you want the message deleted, the
message will not be downloaded but will be deleted.

<P>

All downloaded messages will be automatically filed in your
<b><code>Inbox</code></b>.  If you hit the <b><code>Cancel</code></b>
button in the middle of a POP3 mail transfer, any already downloaded
messages will be preserved on your Pilot, but no messages will be deleted
from the POP3 server.

<P>

Note: to send your draft messages and download your POP mail all at once,
you can tap the <b><code>Both</code></b> button at the bottom of the main
title screen.

<h2><a name="faq">Frequently Asked Questions</a></h2>

<ol>
     <li> <b>Why can't Top Gun Postman drop my PPP connection when I'm done
	  downloading/sending mail?</b>
	  <P>
	  Top Gun Postman doesn't control PPP - Palm OS automatically
	  forges the default PPP connection when the network library is
	  accessed.  A useful trick, however, is to simply turn off the
	  Pilot by pressing the green button instead of going to the
	  Network preferences screen to manually disconnect PPP.
	  Turning off the Pilot causes an open PPP connection to be
	  gracefully shut down.
	  <P>
	  
     <li> <b>What is the maximum message size that Top Gun Postman
	  handles?</b>
	  <p>
	  Mail Inbox records are limited to roughly 32KB in size by Palm
	  OS, so
	  we cannot store mail messages larger than this.  We do gracefully
	  handle larger messages by truncating them as needed.
	  <p>

     <li> <b>Can Top Gun Postman handle file attachments?</b>
	  <p>
	  Nope.  Maybe in the future, but no promises.
	  <p>
