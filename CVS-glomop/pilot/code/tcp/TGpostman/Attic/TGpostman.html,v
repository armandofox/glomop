<h2><a name="intro">Introduction</a></h2>


Top Gun Postman is a POP3/APOP3 and SMTP capable mail dispatcher that runs
on the Palm Pilot Professional.  Top Gun Postman enables you to send mail
messages that you have composed offline, and retrieve mail messages waiting
for you in your POP3/APOP3 accessible mail spool.  Top Gun Postman is
<i>not</i> a complete mail package - it relies on the built-in Mail program
that is built into the Palm Pilot Pro for the composition and viewing of
messages.

<h2><a name="insta">Downloading and Installing Top Gun Postman</a></h2>

<ol>
     <li> <a
href="http://www.isaac.cs.berkeley.edu/pilot/TGpostman.zip">Download
TGpostman.zip</a> and unzip the archive.
     <li> Install TGpostman.prc on your pilot (using Pilot Desktop on your
Windows machine or pilot-xfer on your linux machine).
</ol>

You are now ready to configure Top Gun Postman.


<h2><a name="confi">Configuring Top Gun Postman</a></h2>

<ol>
     <li> Ensure that your Network and Modem preferences on your Pilot are
	  set correctly to establish a PPP connection.
     <li> Open the <b>TG Postman</b> application.
     <li> Click on the <code>Menu</code> button to bring up the menus.
     <li> Click on the <code>About</code> menu, and select
	  <code>About...</code>.  Enjoy our cool attribution and
	  the 1 bit photo of ourselves.
     <li> Click on the <code>Menu</code> button, and select the
	  <code>SMTP Prefs...</code> item under the <code>Options</code>
	  menu.
     <li> Enter the hostname or IP address of your SMTP server in the first
	  field.
     <li> Enter your email address in the second field.
     <li> Enter your real name in the third field.
     <li> Click on the <code>Save</code> button.
     <li> Select the <code>Pop Prefs...</code> item under the
	  <code>Options</code> menu.
     <li> Enter the hostname or IP address of your POP3 server in the first
	  field.
     <li> Enter your POP3 username in the second field.
     <li> Enter your POP3 password in the third field.  If you are using
	  APOP, click on the checkbox next to <code>Use APOP</code>.
     <li> If you want to see headers other than <code>To:, From:, Cc:,
	  </code> and <code>Subject</code>, click on the checkbox next to
	  <code>Paste extra headers into body</code>.  These extra headers
	  will appear at the head of the message body.
     <li> If you want to automatically delete messages from the server
	  after downloading them, click on the checkbox next to
	  <code>Delete messages from the server</code>.
     <li> If you want Top Gun Postman to query you for what to do before
	  downloading each message (giving you the opportunity to view the
	  headers for a message before downloading it), click on the
	  checkbox next to <code>Query for each message</code>.  This is
	  useful in case people like sending you postscript or large MIME
	  inclusions by email.  I guarantee things will go awry (but
	  gracefully awry) if you try to download a really big email message.
     <li> Click on the <code>Save</code> button.
</ol>

You are now ready to use Top Gun Postman.

<h2>Using Top Gun Postman</h2>

<h3><a name="compo">Composing Mail</a></h3>

To compose mail, use the <code>Mail</code> application that is built into
the Palm Pilot Professional.  Your composed mail will be filed in your
<b>Outbox</b>, which is where Top Gun Postman will look for messages to send.

<h3><a name="sendi">Sending Mail</a></h3>

To send previously composed mail, launch <code>TG Postman</code> and press
on the <code>Send mail</code> button.  Top Gun Postman will attempt to start a
PPP session (if one hasn't already been started), and then will connect to
the configured SMTP server and send your mail.  All successfully sent mail
messages will be refiled in the <code>Filed</code> folder.

<h3><a name="recei">Receiving Mail</a></h3>

In order to receive new mail messages, launch <code>TG Postman</code> and
press on the <code>Get mail</code> button.  Top Gun Postman will start a
PPP session, and then will connect to the POP server.  Once authentication
has succeeded, Top Gun Postman will begin downloading messages.

<P>

If you have indicated that you want Top Gun Postman to query you for each
message, a dialog box will pop up before each message is downloaded; this
dialog box contains two buttons and a checkbox as well as the message
headers and size.  Toggle the <code>delete message</code> checkbox if you
want the message to be deleted from the server.  Then, click on either the
<code>Get Message</code> or the <code>Skip Message</code> button depending
on whether you want the message to be retrieved or not.  Note: if you click
on <code>Skip Message</code> and indicate that you want the message
deleted, the message will not be downloaded but will be deleted.

<P>

All downloaded messages will be automatically filed in your
<code>Inbox</code>.  If you hit the <code>Cancel</code> button in the
middle of a POP mail transfer, any already downloaded messages will be
preserved on your Pilot, but no messages will be deleted from the POP
server.
