@Chunks are sent with the following header
(all numbers are unsigned)
a 32 bit requestID
a 32 bit meta-data size
a 32 bit data size
a 32 bit compression type

followed by meta-data followed by data.

currently requestID and compression type are ignored.

Eventually a request ID of 0 will mean a control message.  (more on
control messages later on).

All data (meta and regular) will be compressed by the compression type
as two seperate items.  The size field for each should be the size of the 
COMPRESSED data.

All responses to a request should use the same request ID.  Requests
originateda from the client should start with a requestID of 1 and
count up.  Requests originated from the server should start at 2^32-1
and count down.

There is no handshaking when opening a connection right now.  In the
future there will be a handshake that consists of the client passing a
32 bit mask consisting of the compression types it understands and the
server responding with a 32 bit mask consisting of the compression
types it understands that the client understands.

Control Messages...
If a requestID is 0 the Chunk is a control chunk.  

The meta-data of any control chunk should be the following

a 32 bit controlID
a 32 bit control code

any data required for the control code will be put in the data section.

Once again controlIDs sent from the client sohuld start at 1 and count up,
while controlIDs sent from the server should start at 2^32-1 and count down.

If a response is required to a control code the response should use
the same controlID as the original.

Current control codes are

Type : END CONNECTION
Code : 0x0001
Info : Connection has been dropped.  The conneciton should not be assumed
     : to be re-obtainable.
Data : 32 bit RequestID - last requestID sent
     : 32 bit RequestID - last requestID recieved
Resp : None

Type : CLOSE CONNECTION
Code : 0x0002
Info : Connection has been closed.  It is assumed that the connection should
     : be able to be reopened.  Both sides should be able to handle a dropped
     : connection that does not send this control message however.
Data : 32 bit RequestID - last requestID sent
     : 32 bit RequestID - last requestID recieved
Resp : None

Type : CLOSE REQUEST
Code : 0x0003
Info : The request specified should be considered no longer important.  No
     : more chunks for that request should be sent.
Data : 32 bit requestID - requestID to close
Resp : None
