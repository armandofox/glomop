@pilotSSLeay-2.0 changes:

 o Switched from SSLeay-0.6.6 to SSLeay-0.8.1.  Unfortunately, this made the
   API change, so check your apps.
 o The expensive bignum operations were rewritten in asm, almost tripling
   the speed of an RSA 1024-bit private key operation (now 28 seconds).
 o You can now save the state of the PRNG to a database:

    char filename[32];
    RAND_file_name(filename, 32);       /* Sets the default filename */
    RAND_write_file(filename);          /* Saves the state in that file */

 o You can also seed the PRNG with the contents of any database.  Go wild!

    char filename[32];
    RAND_file_name(filename, 32);       /* Sets the default filename */
    RAND_load_file(filename, 65535);    /* Read up to 65535 bytes from the
                                           database */
    RAND_load_file("MemoDB", 65535);    /* Use your memos as seed */
    RAND_load_db(localid, 65535);       /* Use an arbitrary db, specified by
                                           LocalID */


pilotSSLeay-1.1 changes:

 o The libraries (both static and shared) now require much less of the
   Pilot's precious dynamic RAM.
 o The above change causes some libraries to take up more of the (read-only)
   memory for the text segment, so the test app, when linked statically,
   went over the 32K max code segment size.  Blowfish was removed from the
   default list of libs statically linked against the test app.
 o The shared libs were compiled with the most recent GLib package.
 o librsa_s.a was mistakenly not built in shlib/.  Fixed.
 o RSA_generate_key() had a bug if the BN library was shared (it tried to use
   BN_value_one).  Fixed.
