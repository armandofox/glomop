@helpful tip for compiling on non-linux boxen

@This is version 1.0 of ppmtoTbmp, a ppm to Pilot bitmap converter.

To compile it, you'll need the netpbm package.  Last I checked, it was
available at "ftp://ftp.x.org/contrib/utilities/netpbm-1mar1994.p1.tar.gz".
Change the Makefile to point to the directory that contains the netpbm
header files, and make.

[UCB users: you can compile it on "any" machine that can see SWW, with
this command line:  
       `gmake CFLAGS=-I/usr/sww/include LDFLAGS=-L/usr/sww/lib CC=gcc'
]

Usage: ppmtoTbmp [-2bit] [file.ppm]

If the ppm file is not specified, one is read from stdin.  The -2bit option
produces a 2-bit bitmap instead of the normal 1-bit bitmap.  The ppm must
have at most 4 colours in it (for 2-bit) or at most 2 colours (for 1-bit).
Common invokations might be:

xbmtopbm icon.xbm | ppmquant -fs -map q2.map | ppmtoTbmp > tAIB03e8.bin
giftopnm image.gif | ppmquant -fs -map q4.map | ppmtoTbmp -2bit > Tbmp0bb8.bin

(q2.map and q4.map are trivial 2 and 4 colour maps, respectively, and are
included in this distribution.)

To include the resulting bitmap in a .prc file, just name the output
tAIB03e8.bin (for an application icon) or Tbmpxxxx.bin (for a form bitmap,
where xxxx is replaced by four hex digits giving the bitmap ID).

I'll probably make Tbmptopnm later, and put it in the 1.1 release.
