Introduction

   Top Gun Postman is a POP3/APOP3 and SMTP capable mail dispatcher that
   runs on the Palm Pilot Professional. Top Gun Postman enables you to
   send mail messages that you have composed offline, and retrieve mail
   messages that are waiting for you in your POP3/APOP3 accessible mail
   spool. Top Gun Postman is _not_ a complete mail package - it relies on
   the built-in Mail program that is distributed with the Palm Pilot Pro
   for the composition and viewing of messages.
   
   This release is a _beta_ version of the program, which means that
   although we believe we've eliminated most of the bugs, you may still
   run across a few. If so, please report them.
   
Downloading and Installing Top Gun Postman

    1. Download TGpostman.zip and unzip the archive.
    2. Install _TGpostman.prc_ on your pilot (using Pilot Desktop on your
       Windows machine or pilot-xfer on your Unix machine).
       
   You are now ready to configure Top Gun Postman.
   
Configuring Top Gun Postman

    1. Ensure that your Network and Modem preferences on your Pilot are
       set correctly to establish a PPP connection.
    2. Open the _TG Postman_ application.
    3. Click on the _Menu_ button to bring up the menus.
    4. Click on the _About_ menu, and select _About..._. Enjoy our cool
       attribution and the 1 bit photo of ourselves.
    5. Click on the _Menu_ button, and select the _SMTP Prefs..._ item
       under the _Options_ menu.
    6. Enter the hostname or IP address of your SMTP server in the first
       field.
    7. Enter your email address in the second field.
    8. Enter your real name in the third field.
    9. Click on the _Save_ button.
   10. Select the _Pop Prefs..._ item under the _Options_ menu.
   11. Enter the hostname or IP address of your POP3 server in the first
       field.
   12. Enter your POP3 username in the second field.
   13. Enter your POP3 password in the third field. If you are using
       APOP, click on the checkbox next to _Use APOP_.
   14. If you want to see headers other than _To:, From:, Cc:, _and
       _Subject_, click on the checkbox next to _Paste extra headers into
       body_. These extra headers will appear at the beginning of the
       message.
   15. If you want to automatically delete messages from the server after
       downloading them, click on the checkbox next to _Delete messages
       from the server_.
   16. If you want Top Gun Postman to query you for what to do before
       downloading each message (giving you the opportunity to view the
       headers for a message before downloading it), click on the
       checkbox next to _Query for each message_. This is useful in case
       people like sending you postscript or large MIME inclusions by
       email. I guarantee things will go awry (but gracefully awry) if
       you try to download a really big email message.
   17. Click on the _Save_ button.
       
   You are now ready to use Top Gun Postman.
   
Using Top Gun Postman

  Composing Mail
  
   To compose mail, use the _Mail_ application that is built into the
   Palm Pilot Professional. Your composed mail will be filed in your
   _Outbox_, which is where Top Gun Postman will look for messages to
   send. If the very first line of your mail message is _##_ (on a line
   by itself), then all subsequent lines until a completely blank line
   are treated as additional headers.
   
  Sending Mail
  
   To send previously composed mail, launch _TG Postman_ and press on the
   _Send mail_ button. Top Gun Postman will attempt to start a PPP
   session (if one hasn't already been started), and then will connect to
   the configured SMTP server and send your mail. All successfully sent
   mail messages will be refiled in the _Filed_ folder.
   
  Receiving Mail
  
   In order to receive new mail messages, launch _TG Postman_ and press
   on the _Get mail_ button. Top Gun Postman will start a PPP session (if
   necessary), and then will connect to the POP server. Once
   authentication has succeeded, Top Gun Postman will begin downloading
   messages.
   
   If you have indicated that you want Top Gun Postman to query you for
   each message, a dialog box will pop up after the header of each
   message is downloaded; this dialog box contains two buttons and a
   checkbox as well as the message headers and size. (If your POP3 server
   does not support the "Top" command, you won't be able to preview the
   message headers, and will only see the message size.) Toggle the
   _Delete message_ checkbox if you want the message to be deleted from
   the server. Then, click on either the _Get Message_ or the _Skip
   Message_ button depending on whether you want the message to be
   retrieved or not. Note: if you click on _Skip Message_ and indicate
   that you want the message deleted, the message will not be downloaded
   but will be deleted.
   
   All downloaded messages will be automatically filed in your _Inbox_.
   If you hit the _Cancel_ button in the middle of a POP3 mail transfer,
   any already downloaded messages will be preserved on your Pilot, but
   no messages will be deleted from the POP3 server.
