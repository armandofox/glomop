@=head1 NAME

gdbtut - GDB on Pilot/PalmOS quick start

=head1 SYNOPSIS

A quick tutorial on how to use I<gdb> to interactively debug (using
I<xcopilot> or a real Pilot) programs compiled with the Pilot GNU tools.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

=head2 What to put in your Pilot app

Compile with both C<-g> and C<-DDEBUG>.  If you use C<-DDEBUG> but
there's no debugger running when you start the program on I<xcopilot>,
you will hang and have to quit I<xcopilot> (or reset the Pilot).

You need the C<StartDebug> function in your code somewhere.  Someday
this will move into the I<gcc> library but for now it's in the app
template (you'll have to uncomment it).  Your program should call
C<StartDebug> at the point where it wants F<gdb> to get control.

=head2 Starting up with gdb

=over 4

=item 1.

Be sure F</dev/ptyqf> and F</dev/ttyqf> (or whichever pty and tty you
want to use) are readable and 
writable. 

=item 2.

If you're debugging on the simulator, start I<xcopilot> with:

  xcopilot [-noxshm] -gdebug [ttyname]

ttyname defaults to F</dev/ptyqf>  but
you can make it something else if you're not using F<qf> as your pty in
the previous step.  -noxshm isn't needed if you're using XFree86 but is
needed if you're using MetroX.

If you're debugging on the real Pilot, install the program.

=item 3.

Start I<gdb> with:

  m68k-palmos-coff-gdb binaryfilename

Note, that's the binary, B<not> the .prc file.

=item 4.

To debug with I<xcopilot>, say to I<gdb>:

  target pilot /dev/ttyqf

(Note that's B<tty> not B<pty>.)
To debug with a real Pilot, say instead:

  target pilot /dev/pilot

(or whatever the name of the serial port device connected to the Pilot is).

=item 5.

I<Gdb> should connect to I<xcopilot>'s pty or the real Pilot's serial
port.  Start your program, and you'll fall into I<gdb> when
C<StartDebug> is called.

Doubtless many.
