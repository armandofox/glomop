=head2 Building a Program

A program consists of an 'appl' database containing at least the
following resources: 

 code 0

 rloc 0
 pref 0
 Tfrm 1000

Once you have all these, you run F<buildprc> to create a F<.prc> file
that can be installed on the Pilot.

In general, creating a resource involves running the right program (eg
I<gcc>) to create the actual object, then run I<pilrc> to convert it
into a resource.

=head3 Your Code

Your code should begin with

  #include <Pilot.h>

The main routine in your program is C<PilotMain()>, which takes three
arguments:
