1.3
log
@Many changes to support SDK, including bin and sbin directories,
and modified make targets and names of some binary targets.  Calling
convention changed for perl distillers, so fixed html distiller and
added it as transend.text.html.  monitor.multicast property is now
Monitor.listen; all relevant code was changed.  Monitor can now parse
this from the options file.  Updated all UI changes from branch head.
