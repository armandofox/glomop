<H2>Abstract
</H2><P>
The Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML) is a complex system
for developing markup languages. It is used to define the Hypertext
Markup Language (HTML) used in the World Wide Web, as well as
several other hypermedia document representations.
<P>
Systems with interactive performance constraints use only the
simplest features of SGML. Unfortunately, the specification of
those features is subtly mixed into the specification of SGML
in all its generality. As a result, a number of ad-hoc SGML lexical
analyzers have been developed and deployed on the Internet, and
reliability has suffered.
<P>
We present a self-contained specification of a lexical analyzer
that uses automated parsing techniques to handle SGML document
types limited to a tractable set of SGML features. An implementation is available
as well.<HR>
<H2>Introduction
</H2><BLOCKQUOTE>The hypertext markup language is an SGML format.
<ADDRESS>--Tim Berners-Lee, in "About HTML"
</ADDRESS></BLOCKQUOTE><P>
The result of that design decision is something of a collision
between the World Wide Web development community and the SGML
community -- between the quick-and-dirty software community and the
formal ISO standards community. It also creates a collision between
the interactive, online hypermedia technology and the bulk, batch
print publications technology.
<P>SGML, Standard General Markup Language, is a complex, mature,
stable technology. The international standard, ISO
8879:1986<A
href="#SGML">[SGML]</A>, is nearly ten years old, and GML-based
systems pre-date the standard by years. On the other hand, HTML,
Hypertext Markup Lanugage, is a relatively simple, new and rapidly
evolving technology.
<P>
SGML has a number of degrees of freedom which are bound in HTML.
SGML is a system for defining markup languages, and HTML is one
such language; in standard terminology, HTML is an SGML application.
<H3>Lexical Analysis of Basic SGML Documents
</H3><P>The degrees of freedom in SGML which the HTML 2.0
specification<A
href="#HTML2.0">[HTML2.0]</A> binds can be separated into high-level,
document structure considerations on the one hand, and low-level,
lexical details on the other.  The document structure issues are
specific to the domain of application of HTML, and they are evolving
rapidly to reflect new features in the web.
<P>
The lexical properties of HTML 2.0 are very stable by comparison.
HTML documents fit into a category termed <EM>basic SGML documents</EM>
in the SGML standard, with a few exceptions &nbsp;(see
<A HREF="#differences">below</A>).
These properties are independent of the domain of application
of HTML. They are shared by a number of contemporary SGML applications,
such as TEI<A href="#TEI">[TEI]</A>, DocBook<A href="#DocBook">[DocBook]</A>,
HTF<A href="#HTF">[HTF]</A>, and
IBM-IDDOC<A href="#IBM-IDDOC">[IBM-IDDOC]</A>.
<P>
The specification of this straightforward category of SGML documents
is, unfortunately, subtly mixed into the specification of SGML
in all its generality.
<P>
An unfortunate result is that a number of lexically incompatible
HTML parser implementations have been developed and deployed.[REF!
Mosaic 2.4, Cern libwww parser].
<P>
The objectives of the document are to:
<OL><LI>refine the notion of "basic SGML document" to the
precise set of features used in HTML 2.0.
<LI>present a more traditional automated model of lexical analysis
and parsing for these SGML documents<A href="#dragon">[Dragon]</A>.
<LI>make a rigorous specification of this lexical analyzer that
can be understood without prior knowledge of SGML freely available
to the web development community.
</OL><P>While this report focuses on the SGML features necessary for HTML
2.0 user agents, it should be applicable to future HTML versions and to
extensions of the HTML standard<A HREF="#HTMLDIALECT">[HTMLDIALECT]</A>,
as well as other SGML applications used on the
internet<A HREF="#SGMLMEDIA">[SGMLMEDIA]</A>. See the <A HREF="#future">"Future
Work"</A> section for discussion.
<P><HR>
<H2>SGML and Document Types
</H2><H3>SGML Documents
</H3><P>
An SGML document is a sequence of characters organized as one or more entities
for storage and transmission, with a logical hierarchy of elements imposed.
<P>The organization of an SGML document into entities is analagous to
the organization of a C program into source files<A
href="#KnR2">[KnR2]</A>. This report does not formally address entity
structure.  We restrict our discussion to documents consisting of a
single entity.
<P>
The element hierarchy of an SGML document is actually the last
of three parts. The first two are the SGML declaration and the
prologue.
<P>The SGML declaration binds certain variables such as the character
strings that serve delimiter roles, and the optional features
used. The SGML declaration also specifies the document character set
-- the set of characters allowed in the document and their
corresponding character numbers.
For a discussion of the&nbsp;SGML declaration, see
<A HREF="#SGMLDECL">[SGMLDECL]</A>.
<P>
The prologue, or DTD, declares the element types allowed in the
document, along with their attributes and content models. The
content models express the order and occurence of elements in
the hierarchy.
<H3>Document Types and Element Structure
</H3><P>
SGML facilitates the development of <EM>document types</EM>, or
specialized markup languages. An <EM>SGML application</EM> is
a set of rules for using one or more document types. Typically,
a community such as an industry segment, after identifying a need
to interchange data in a rigorous method, develops an SGML application
suited to their practices.
<P>
The document type definition includes two parts: a formal part,
expressed in SGML, called a document type declaration or DTD,
and a set of application conventions. An overview of the syntax of a DTD
follows. For a more complete discussion, see
<A HREF="#SGMLINTRO">[SGMLINTRO]</A>.
<P>
The DTD essentially gives a grammar for the element structure
of the specialized markup language: the start symbol is the document
element name; the productions are specified in element declarations,
and the terminal symbols are start-tags, end-tags, and data characters.
For example:
<PRE><P>
&lt;!doctype Memo [
&lt;!element Memo         - - (Salutation, P*, Closing?)&gt;
&lt;!element Salutation   O O (Date &amp; To &amp; Address?)&gt;
&lt;!element (P|Closing|To|Address) - O (#PCDATA)&gt;
&lt;!element Date - O EMPTY&gt;
&lt;!attlist Date
	numeric CDATA #REQUIRED
]&gt;
</PRE><P>
These four element declarations specify that a Memo consists
of a Salutation, zero or more P elements, and an optional Closing.
The Salutation is a Date, To, and optionally, an Address.
<P>The notation "- -" specifies that both start and end tags
are required; "O O" specifies both are optional, and "-
O" specifies that the start tag is required, but the end tag is
optional. The notation <TT>#PCDATA</TT> refers to parsed character
data -- data characters with auxiliary markup such as comments mixed
in. An element declared <TT>EMPTY</TT> has no content and no end-tag.
<P>The <TT>ATTLIST</TT> declaration specifies that the <TT>Date</TT>
element has an attribute called <TT>numeric</TT>. The
<TT>#REQUIRED</TT> notation says that each <TT>Date</TT> start-tag
must specify a value for the Date attribute.
<P>
The following is a sample instance of the memo document type:
<PRE><P>
&lt;!doctype memo system&gt;
&lt;Memo&gt;
&lt;Date numeric="1994-06-12"&gt; 
&lt;To&gt;Third Floor
&lt;p&gt;Please limit coffee breaks to 10 minutes.
&lt;Closing&gt;The Management
&lt;/Memo&gt;
</PRE><P>
The following left-derivation shows the nearly self-evident structure
of SGML documents when viewed at this level:
<PRE><P>
Memo -&gt; &lt;Memo&gt;, Salutation, P, Closing, &lt;/Memo&gt;	
Salutation -&gt; Date, To	
Date -&gt; &lt;Date numeric="1994-06-12"&gt;	
To -&gt; &lt;To&gt;, "Third Floor"	
P -&gt; &lt;P&gt;, "Please limit coffee breaks to 10 minutes."	
Closing -&gt; &lt;Closing&gt;, "The Management"
</PRE><P>
This lexical analyzer in this report reports events at this level:
start-tags, end-tags, and data.

<HR>
<H2>Basic SGML Language Constructs
</H2><P>Basic SGML documents are like ordinary text files, but the
text is enhanced with certain constructs called <EM>markup</EM>.
The markup constructs add structure to documents.
<P>The lexical analyzer separates the characters of a document into
markup and data characters. Markup is separated from data charcters by
delimiters. The SGML delimiter recognition rules include a certain
amount of context information. For example, the delimiter string
"&lt;/" is only recognized as markup when it is followed by a letter.
<P>For a formal specification of the language constructs, see
<A
HREF="sgml.l">the lex specification</A> (which is part of the implementation
source distribution<A HREF="#DIST">[DIST]</A>).  The following is an informal
overview.
<H3>Markup Declarations
</H3><P>Each SGML document begins with a document type declaration. Comment
declarations and marked section delcarations are other types of markup
declarations.
<P>The string <TT>&lt;!</TT> followed by a name begins a markup
declaration.  The name is followed by parameters and a <TT>&gt;</TT>. A
<TT>[</TT> in the parameters opens a <EM>declaration subset</EM>,
which is a construct prohibited by this report.
<P>The string <TT>&lt;!--</TT> begins a comment declaration.  The
<TT>--</TT> begins a comment, which continues until the next
occurrence of <TT>--</TT>. A comment declaration can contain zero or
more comments. The string <TT>&lt;!&gt;</TT> is an empty comment declaration.
<P>The string <TT>&lt;![</TT> begins a marked section declaration, which
is
prohibited by this report.
<P>For example:
<PRE><P>
&lt;!doctype foo&gt;
&lt;!DOCTYPE foo SYSTEM&gt;
&lt;!doctype bar system "abcdef"&gt;
&lt;!doctype BaZ public "-//owner//DTD description//EN"&gt;
&lt;!doctype BAZ Public "-//owner//DTD desc//EN" "sysid"&gt;
&lt;!&gt;
another way to escape &lt; and &amp;: &lt;&lt;!&gt;xxx &amp;&lt;!&gt;abc;
&lt;!-- xyz --&gt;
&lt;!-- xyz -- --def--&gt;
&lt;!---- ---- ----&gt;
&lt;!------------&gt;
&lt;!doctype foo --my document type-- system "abc"&gt;
</PRE><P>
The following examples contain no markup. They illustrate that
"&lt;!" does not always signal markup.
<PRE>&lt;! doctype&gt; &lt;!,doctype&gt; &lt;!23&gt;
&lt;!- xxx -&gt; &lt;!-&gt; &lt;!-!&gt;
</PRE><P>
The following are errors:
<PRE>&lt;!doctype xxx,yyy&gt;
<P>&lt;!usemap map1&gt;
<P>&lt;!-- comment-- xxx&gt;
<P>&lt;!-- comment -- -&gt;
<P>&lt;!-----&gt;
</PRE><P>The following are errors, but they are not reported by this lexical
analyzer.
<PRE>&lt;!doctype foo foo foo&gt;
&lt;!doctype foo 23 17&gt;
&lt;!junk decl&gt;
</PRE><P>
The following are valid SGML constructs that are prohibited by
this report:
<PRE><P>
&lt;!doctype doc [ &lt;!element doc - - ANY&gt; ]&gt;
&lt;![ IGNORE [ lkjsdflkj sdflkj sdflkj  ]]&gt;
&lt;![ CDATA [ lskdjf lskdjf lksjdf ]]&gt;
</PRE><H3>Tags
</H3><P>Tags are used to delimit elements. Most elements have a start-tag,
some content, and end-tag. Empty elements have only a start-tag. For
some elements, the start-tag and/or end-tag are optional. @@@@
<P>A start-tag begins with <TT>&lt;</TT> followed by a name, and ends
with <TT>&gt;</TT>. The name refers to an element declaration
in the DTD. An end-tag is
similar, but begins with <TT>&lt;/</TT>.
<P>For example:
<PRE>&lt;x&gt; yyy &lt;/X&gt;
&lt;abc.DEF   &gt; ggg &lt;/abc.def &gt;
&lt;abc123.-23&gt;
&lt;A&gt;abc def &lt;b&gt;xxx&lt;/b&gt;def&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;A&gt;abc def &lt;b&gt;xxxdef&lt;/a&gt;
</PRE><P>
The following examples contain no markup. They illustrate that
a the <TT>&lt;</TT> and <TT>&lt;/</TT> strings do not always
signal markup.
<PRE>&lt; x &gt; &lt;324 &lt;/234&gt;
&lt;==&gt; &lt; b&gt;
&lt;%%%&gt; &lt;---&gt; &lt;...&gt; &lt;---&gt;
</PRE><P>
The following examples are errors:
<PRE>&lt;xyz!&gt; &lt;abc/&gt;
&lt;/xxx/&gt; &lt;xyz&amp;def&gt; &lt;abc_def&gt;
</PRE><P>
These last few examples illustrate valid SGML constructs that
are prohibited in the languages described by this report:
<PRE>&lt;&gt; xyz &lt;/&gt;
&lt;xxx&lt;yyy&gt; &lt;/yyy&lt;/xxx&gt;
&lt;xxx/content/
</PRE><H3>Names
</H3><P>A name is a name-start characer -- a letter -- followed by any
number <!--@@@@limit?--> of name characters -- letters, digits, periods,
or hyphens. Entity names are case sensitive, but all other names are
not.
<H3>Attributes
</H3><P>Start tags may contain attribute specifications. An attribute
specification consists of a name, an "=" and a value
specification. The name refers to an item in an <TT>ATTLIST</TT>
declaration.
<P>The value can be a name token or an attribute value literal. A name
token is one or more name characters. An attribute value literal is a
string delimited by double-quotes (<TT>"</TT>) or a string delimited
by single-quotes (<TT>'</TT>). Interpretation of attribute value literals
is covered in the <A href="#API">discussion of the lexical analyzer API</A>.
<P>If the <TT>ATTLIST</TT> declaration specifies an enumerated list of
names, and the value specification is one of those names, the
attribute name and "=" may be omitted.
<P>For example:
<PRE>&lt;x attr="val"&gt;
&lt;x ATTR ="val" val&gt;
&lt;y aTTr1= "val1"&gt;
&lt;yy attr1='xyz' attr2="def" attr3='xy"z' attr4="abc'def"&gt;
&lt;xx abc='abc&amp;#34;def'&gt;
&lt;xx aBC="fred &amp;amp; barney"&gt;
&lt;z attr1 = val1 attr2 = 23 attr3 = 'abc'&gt;
&lt;xx val1 val2 attr3=.76meters&gt;
&lt;a href=foo.html&gt; ..&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=foo-bar.html&gt;..&lt;/a&gt;
</PRE><P>
The following examples illustrate errors:
<PRE>&lt;x attr = abc$#@@&gt;
&lt;y attr1,attr2&gt;
&lt;tt =xyz&gt;
&lt;z attr += 2&gt;
&lt;xx attr=50%&gt;
&lt;a href=http://foo/bar/&gt;
&lt;a href="http://foo/bar/&gt; ... &lt;/a&gt; ... &lt;a href="xyz"&gt;...&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;xx "abc"&gt;
&lt;xxx abc=&gt;
</PRE><H3>Character References and Entity References
</H3><P>Characters in the document character set can be referred to by
numeric character references. Entities declared in the DTD can be
referred to by entity references.
<P>An entity reference begins with
"&amp;" followed by a name, followed by an optional semicolon.
<P>A numeric character reference begins with "&amp;#" followed by a
number followed by an optional semicolon. (The string "&amp;#"
followed by a name is a construct prohibited by this report.)  A
number is a sequence of digits.
<P>The
following examples illustrate character references and entity
references:
<PRE><P>
&amp;#38; &amp;#200;
&amp;amp; &amp;ouml;
&amp;#38 &amp;#200,xxx
&amp;amp &amp;abc() &amp;xy12/..\
To illustrate the X tag, write &amp;lt;X&amp;gt;
</PRE><P>
These examples contain no markup. They illustrate that "&amp;" does
not always signal markup.
<PRE>a &amp; b, a &amp;# b
a &amp;, b &amp;. c
a &amp;#-xx &amp;100
</PRE><P>
These examples are errors:
<PRE><P>
&amp;#2000000; &amp;#20.7 &amp;#20-35
&amp;#23x;
</PRE><P>
The following are valid SGML, but prohibited by this report:
<PRE><P>
&amp;#SPACE;
&amp;#RE;
</PRE><H3>Processing Instructions
</H3><P>Processing instructions are a mechanism to capture platform-specific
idioms. A processing instruction begins with <TT>&lt;?</TT> and ends with
<TT>&gt;</TT>.
<P>For example:
<P>
&lt;?&gt;<BR>
&lt;?style tt = font courier&gt;<BR>
&lt;?page break&gt;<BR>
&lt;?experiment&gt; ... &lt;?/experiment&gt;

<HR>
<H2><A name="API">The Application Programmer Interface (API) to the
Lexical Analyzer</A>
</H2><P>An implementation of this specification is
available<A HREF="#DIST">[DIST]</A>, in the form of an ANSI C library. This
section documents the API to the library. Note that the library is undergoing
testing and revision. <EM>The API is expected to change</EM>.
<P>The client of the lexical analyzer creates a data structure to hold
the state of the lexical analyzer with a call to
<TT>SGML_newLexer</TT>, and uses calls to <TT>SGML_lex</TT> to scan
the data. Constructs are reported to the caller via three callback
functions. <TT>SGML_lexNorm</TT>is used to set case folding of names and
whitespace normalization, and
<TT>SGML_lexLine </TT>can be used to get the number of lines the lexer has
encountered.
<P>The output of the lexical analyzer, for each construct, is an an
array of strings, and an array of enumerated types in one-to-one
correspondence with the strings.
<H3>Data Characters
</H3><P>Data characters are passed to the primary callback function as an
array of one single string containing the data characters and
<TT>SGML_DATA</TT> as the type.
<P>Note that the output contains all newlines (record end characters)
from the input verbatim. Implementing the rules for ignoring record
end characters as per section 7.6.1 of SGML is left to the client.
<H3>Tags and Attributes
</H3><P>Start-tags and end-tags are also passed to the primary callback
function.
<P>For a start-tag, the first element of the output array is a string
of the form <TT>&lt;name</TT> with <TT>SGML_START</TT> as the
corresponding type. If requested (via SGML_lexNorm), the name is folded to
lower-case.  The
remaining elements of the array give the attributes; see below.  For
an end tag, the first element of the array is a case-folded string of
the form <TT>&lt;/name</TT> with <TT>SGML_END</TT> as the type.
<P>The output for attributes is included with the tag in which they
appear. Attributes are reported as name/value pairs. The attribute name is
output as a string of the form <TT>name</TT>
and SGML_ATTRNAME as the type. An ommitted
name is reported as NULL.
<P>An attribute value literal is output as a string of the form "xxx"
or 'xxx' including the quotes, with SGML_LITERAL as the type
<!--(@@@@
split literal into parameter, minimum, and attribute value?)-->.
Other attribute values are returned as a string with
<TT>SGML_NMTOKEN</TT> as the type. For example:
<PRE>&lt;xX val1 val2 aTTr3=".76meters"&gt;
</PRE><P>is passed as an array of six strings:
<PRE>[Tag/Data]
Start Tag: `&lt;xx'
  Attr Name: `'
  Name: `val1'
  Attr Name: `'
  Name: `val2'
  Attr Name: `attr3'
  Name Token: `.76meters'
  Tag Close: `&gt;'
</PRE><P>Note that attribute value literals are output verbatim.
Interpretation is left to the client.  Section 7.9.3 of SGML says that
an attribute value literal is interpreted as an attribute value by:
<UL><LI>Removing the quotes
<LI>Replacing character and entity references
<LI>Deleting character 10 (ASCII LF)
<LI>Replacing character 9 and 13 (ASCII HT and CR) with character 32 (SPACE)
</UL><H3>Character and Entity References
</H3><P>A character reference refers to the character in
the document character set whose number it specifies. For example, if
the document character set is ISO 646 IRV (aka ASCII), then
<TT>&amp;#65;</TT> is another way to write <TT>"A"</TT>.
<P>A numeric character reference is passed to the primary callback as
an event whose first token type is <TT>SGML_NUMCHARREF</TT> and whose
string takes the form <TT>&amp;#999</TT>. The second token, if
present, has type <TT>SGML_REFC</TT>, and consists of a <TT>;</TT> or
a newline.
<P>A general entity reference is passed as an event whose first token
is of the form <TT>&amp;name</TT> with <TT>SGML_GEREF</TT> as its
type.  The second token, if present, has type <TT>SGML_REFC</TT>, and
consists of a semicolon or a newline.
<P> The reference should be checked against those declared in the DTD
by the client.
<H3>Other Markup
</H3><P>Other markup is passed to the second callback function.
<P>A comment declaration is reported the string <TT>&lt;!</TT> with
type <TT>SGML_MARKUP_DECL</TT>, followed by zero or more strings of
the form <TT>-- comment --</TT> with <TT>SGML_COMMENT</TT> as the
type, followed by <TT>&gt; </TT>with type <TT>TAGC</TT> (@@@@should be MDC).
<P>Other markup declarations are output as a string of the form
<TT>&lt;!doctype</TT> followed by strings of type <TT>SGML_NAME</TT>,
<TT>SGML_NUMBER</TT>, <TT>SGML_LITERAL</TT>, and/or
<TT>SGML_COMMENT</TT>, followed by <TT>TAGC</TT>.
<P>For example:
<PRE>&lt;!Doctype Foo --my document type-- System "abc"&gt;
</PRE><P>is reported as
<PRE>[Aux Markup]
Markup Decl: `&lt;!doctype'
  Name: `foo'
  Comment: `--my document type--'
  Name: `system'
  Literal: `"abc"'
  Tag Close: `&gt;'
</PRE><P>A processing instructions is passed as a string of the form
<TT>&lt;?pi stuff&gt;</TT> with type <TT>SGML_PI</TT>.
<H3>Errors and Limitations
</H3><P>Errors are passed to the third callback function.  Two strings and
two types are passed. For errors, the first string is a descriptive
message, and the type is <TT>SGML_ERROR</TT>.  The second string is
the offending data, the the type is <TT>SGML_DATA</TT>.
<P>Limitations imposed in this report are output similarly, but with
type <TT>SGML_LIMITATION</TT> instead of <TT>SGML_ERROR</TT>. The
lexical analyzer skips to a likely end of the error construct before
continuing.
<P>For example:
<PRE>&lt;tag xxx=yyy ?&gt;xxx &lt;![IGNORE[ a&lt;b&gt;c]]&gt; zzz
</PRE><P>
causes six callbacks:
<PRE>[Err/Lim]
!!Error!!: `bad character in tag'
  Data: `?'
[Tag/Data]
Start Tag: `&lt;tag'
  Attr Name: `xxx'
  Name Token: `yyy'
  Tag Close: `&gt;'
[Tag/Data]
Data: `xxx '
[Err/Lim]
!!Limitation!!: `marked sections not supported'
  Data: `&lt;!['
[Err/Lim]
!!Limitation!!: `declaration subset: skipping'
  Data: `IGNORE[ a&lt;b&gt;c'
[Tag/Data]
Data: ` zzz'

<H2><A ID=differences>Differences from Basic SGML</A>
</H2><P>In section 15.1.1 of the SGML standard, a Basic SGML document is
defined as an SGML document that uses the reference concrete syntax
and the <TT>SHORTTAG</TT> and OMITTAG features. A concrete syntax is a

concrete syntax binds the delimiter role <VAR>stago</VAR> to the

and so on. The <TT>OMITTAG</TT> feature allows documents to omit tags
in certain cases that do not introduce ambiguity -- without OMITTAG,
every element's start and end tags must occur in the document. The
<TT>SHORTTAG</TT> feature allows for some short-hand syntax in
attributes and tags.
<P><EM>Some of these exceptions
are likely to be reflected in the ongoing revision of SGML</EM>
<A HREF="#SGMLREV">[SGMLREV]</A>.
<H3>Arbitrary Limitations Removed
</H3><P>The reference concrete syntax includes certain limitations
(capacities and quantities, in the language of the standard).
For most purposes, these limitations are unnecessary. We remove
them:
<DL><DT>Long Names
<DD>The reference concrete syntax binds the parameter <TT>NAMELEN</TT>
to 8. This means that names are limited to 8 characters. We remove
this limitation. Arbitrarily long names are allowed.
<DT>Long Attribute Value Literals
<DD>We similarly remove the limitation of setting <TT>LITLEN</TT>
to 960 and <TT>ATTSPLEN</TT> to 240.
</DL><H3>Simplifications
</H3><P>We require the SGML declaration to be implicit and the DTD to
be included by reference only:
<DL><DT>SGML Declaration
<DD>The SGML declaration is generally transmitted out of band
-- assumed by the sender and the receiver. The lexical analyzer
will accept an in-line SGML declaration, but it will not adhere
to the declarations therein. The lexical analyzer client should
signal an error.
<DT>Internal Declaration Subset
<DD>The DTD is often included by reference, but some documents
contain additional entity, element and attribute declarations
in the <TT>&lt;!DOCTYPE</TT> declaration. We prohibit additional
declarations in the <TT>&lt;!DOCTYPE</TT> declaration (see
<A HREF="#decl-subset">"Internal Declaration Subsets"</A> in the future work
section).
<DT>Parameter Entity Reference
<DD>The <TT>%name;</TT> construct is a parameter entity reference
-- similar to a reference to a C macro. There is little use for
these given the above limitations. An occurrence of a parameter
entity in a markup declaration is prohibited.
<DT>Named Character References
<DD>The construct <TT>&amp;#SPACE;</TT> refers to a space character.
With changes to the SGML declaration prohibited, this adds no
expressive capability to the language. We prohibit it to avoid
interoperability problems.
<DT>Marked Sections
<DD>The construct <TT>&lt;![ IGNORE [ ... ]]&gt; </TT>is similar
to the <TT>#ifdef</TT> construct in the C preprocessor. It is
a novel construct that can be used to represent effectivity (applicability
of parts of a document to various environments, depending on locale,
client capabilities, user preferences, etc.). We expect that it
will be deployed eventually (see <A HREF="marked-sections">"Marked
Sections"</A> in the section on "Future Work"), but to avoid interoperability
issues,
we prohibit its use.
</DL><H3>Shorthand Markup Prohibited
</H3><P>Some constructs save typing, but add no expressive capability to
the languages. And while they technically introduce no ambiguity, they
reduce the robustness of documents, especially when the language is
enhanced to include new elements. The SHORTTAG constructs related to
attributes are widely used and implemented, but those related to tags
are not.
<P>These are relatively straightforward to support, but they are not
widely deployed. While documents that use them are conforming SGML
documents, they will not work with the deployed HTML tools. This lexical
analyzer signals a limitation when encountering these constructs.
<DL><DT>NET tags
<DD><TT>&lt;name/.../</TT>
<DT>Unclosed Start Tag
<DD><TT>&lt;name1&lt;name2&gt;</TT>
<DT>Empty Start Tag
<DD><TT>&lt;&gt;</TT>
<DT>Empty End Tag
<DD><TT>&lt;/&gt;</TT>
</DL><P>In addition, the lexical analyzer assumes no short references
are used.
<H2><A NAME=future>Future Work</A>
</H2><P>This report presents technology that is usable, but not complete.
Work is ongoing in the folloing areas. Contributions are welcome. Send a
note to
<TT><A HREF="http://www.w3.org/pub/WWW/Mail/Lists#www-html">www-html@@w3.org</A></TT>
with "sgml-lex" in the subject.
<H3><A NAME=marked-sections>Marked Sections</A>
</H3><P>Support for marked sections is an integral part of a strategy for
interoperability among HTML user agents supporting different HTML
dialects<A HREF="#HTMLDIALECT">[HTMLDIALECT]</A>. It has other valueable
applicatoins, and it is a straightforward addition to the lexical analyzer
in this report.
<H3><A NAME=i18n>Internationalization </A>
</H3><P>Support for character encodings and coded character sets other
than ASCII is a requirement for production use. Support for the X Windows
compound text encoding (related to ISO-2022) and the UTF-8 or perhaps UCS-2
encoding of Unicode (ISO-10646), with extensibility for other character encodings
seems most desirable.
<H3><A NAME=decl-subset>Internal declaration subset support</A>
</H3><P>Internal declaration subsets are not expected to become a part of
HTML. But the technology in this report is applicable to other SGML applications,
and internal declaration subsets are a straightfoward addition to this lexical
analyzer. Relavent mechanisms include:
<UL><LI>General entity declarations with URIs as system identifiers
<LI>General entity declarations as "macros"
<LI>Parameter entity declarations for "switches" and
"hooks"
</UL><H3>Short References and Empty End-tags
</H3><P>While they may increase the complexity of the lexical analyzer, short
references may be necessary to support math markup in HTML. Empty end-tags
are not likely to be used in HTML, as they interact badly with conventions
for handling undeclared element tags. But in other SGML applications, they
are a useful feature.
