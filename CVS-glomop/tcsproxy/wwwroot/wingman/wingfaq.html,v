<h3>Questions about technology/availability</h3>

<dl>
  <dt> Can I use WingMan with my ISP's proxy server, or with no proxy at
       all?
  <dd> No.  In addition to image compression, the Berkeley Smart Proxy
       completely reformats other content and transmits it to WingMan
       in a compressed data format.  HTML is not WingMan's native markup
       language, nor is HTTP its transport protocol.
       
  <dt> Will Berkeley Smart Proxies be deployed at sites outside the USA?
  <dd> Yes, Real Soon Now we'll try to have proxies running in Europe.
       Other areas are on the way.

  <dt> Can I obtain a distribution of the Berkeley Smart Proxy to
       support WingMan in my intranet or behind my firewall?
  <dd> We're working on a distribution, with terms to be announced.
       Watch the WingMan web page for details.

  <dt> Can I run CGI scripts that do what the Smart Proxy does?
  <dd> Not trivially.  None of the transport interfaces are HTTP, and
       there are several programs that do the work of transforming pages
       to WingMan format.  We plan to investigate ways that this
       functionality could be integrated into Web servers (such as
       server side plug-ins).

  <dt> Will you be releasing the transport protocol or data format spec
       for WingMan?
  <dd> Yes, but it is still a moving target.  We will probably release
       it but not guarantee that the next version of WingMan will adhere
       to it.

  <dt> Can I use WingMan from behind a firewall?
  <dd> Right now the only way is to configure your IP firewall to allow
       TCP connections
       to the host and port specified in the Proxy setting on the
       WingMan Prefs screen.  (WingMan doesn't
       understand HTTP, which makes it much simpler code but also
       prevents it from working properly with HTTP-proxy firewalls.)

  <dt> Since all WingMan users go through your proxy at Berkeley, won't
       the proxy get overloaded?
  <dd> Not for a long time.  The Berkeley Smart Proxy is explicitly
       designed to scale to support hundreds of thousands of users,
       by harnessing clusters of commodity PC's.  We have up to 100
       UltraSPARC servers at our disposal; so far only a handful have
       been used even at peak times.

<h3>Problems using WingMan</h3>

<dl>
  <dt> WingMan crashes or gets other badness when used in conjunction
       with TealEcho.
  <dd> Yep.  They both write directly to screen memory (WingMan has to
       do this to implement 2-bit-per-pixel graphics).  Sorry, but
       there's no immediate fix forthcoming for this.

  <dt> I can't view page <i>x</i>.
  <dd> Pages that contain frames, dynamic HTML, and JavaScript will
       display on WingMan only if the page authors have made provisions
       for browsers without those features.  If that's not the case,
       write to the page authors and politely remind them that not
       everyone in the world uses those features and ask them to provide
       alternate content for the rest of us.  :-)

  <dt> I'm having trouble connecting to my ISP.
  <dd> This is not a WingMan problem.  You need to debug your ISP
       connection before WingMan will work.  If you're able to use Top
       Gun Postman to read email, then WingMan should work properly.

  <dt> I keep getting "Unable to connect to proxy" when WingMan tries to
       retrieve a page.
  <dd> The Berkeley Smart Proxy cluster is up virtually all the time,
       but may be intermittently
       unavailable either because it is recovering from an error or
       because of frequent problems with our (Berkeley's) Internet provider.
       Try again in a few minutes.  If the problem persists, send us email.

<h3>Questions about features</h3>

<dl>
  <dt> When will WingMan run on the Palm Pilot Personal or original Pilot?
  <dd> Probably never; those models lack support for TCP/IP.  Upgrade.

  <dt> When will you support feature <i>x</i>?
  <dd> Here is a list of values of <i>x</i> for which the answer is
       "real soon now":
       <ul>
         <li> Secure connections
         <li> Frames
         <li> Client-side image maps (server side works now)
         <li> Offline browsing tools ("crawl this part of the web and
              make a small Pilot database for offline browsing")
         <li> Per-user control over the image scaling rules and other
              aspects of page layout
       </ul>

  <dt> Will you have a version of Wingman soon that doesn't rely on your proxy
       services at all? I'd really like to be able to go directly to individual
       web sites like Handweb.
  <dd> No.  The point of Wingman is to show the power of proxies; downloading
       a 320x200 24-bit jpeg to the Pilot and having it turn it into a 160x100
       2-bit bitmap is just a lose.  If you want a direct connection, you should
       use HandWeb or Palmscape.  If you want fast access, you should
       use Wingman.  :-)

  <dt> Will there be a commercial version?
  <dd> Stay tuned.
