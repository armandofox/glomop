<a href="http://www.nytimes.com">New York Times on the Web</a> and other
servers that authenticate accesses partially based on the IP address from
which the request is coming will break.

JavaScript (especially ill-formed, illegal JavaScript) sometimes confuses
our HTML lexical analyzer, causing the JavaScript to be corrupted and your
browser to complain.  (But why do you have JavaScript turned on?  It's
insecure.  Maybe this is really a feature and we're just not telling you.)

Your browser's client-side cache may be polluted with distilled
representations of images.  This will only affect you if you stop surfing
the web through the proxy; if you notice cache pollution (some images won't
load, others load in degraded form) then flush your browser's main memory
and disk cache.

Transparent GIFs are no longer transparent after distillation.
