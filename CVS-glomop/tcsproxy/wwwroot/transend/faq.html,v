<a name="what_is_transend"><H3>What is the TranSend Service?</H3></a>
To a first order, TranSend is a <i>infrastructure web accelerator</i>.
TranSend was designed to help ease the pain of accessing the web over slow
links such as dial-up modems or ISDN lines.  Transend is infrastructural
because it runs &quot;inside the network&quot; (as opposed to on your home
machine or on web servers).  This allows you to access any web server
through TranSend immediately - neither you nor web server operators need
to modify their software.

<HR>

<a name="how_use_transend"><H3>How do I use the TranSend Service?</H3></a>

Please visit the <a href="http://transend.cs.berkeley.edu/">TranSend web
site</a> for detailed instructions on how to turn on and use the TranSend
service.  Bear in mind that TranSend has been deployed for the Berkeley
campus - preferential treatment will be given to Berkeley students, staff,
and faculty.  If any &quot;spare&quot; resources are available, they will
be given to non-Berkeley users.

<HR>

<a name="how_work_transend"><H3>How does TranSend work?</H3></a>

TranSend speeds up web surfing through a process we call <i>on-demand,
dynamic, data-type specific distillation</i>.  In other words, the TranSend
proxy intercepts all of your web surfing requests, fetches data from web
servers (or from its large, local cache) on your behalf, and then
transforms the data based on your individual preferences before sending the
data over the modem line to you.  This transformation is usually a
semantically lossy compression - for example, the resolution and colour
depth of images is reduced, yielding much smaller images (by a factor of
2-7) at the cost of slightly reduced image quality.
<p>
TranSend runs on a Network of Workstations (or <a
href="http://now.cs.berkeley.edu">NOW</a>) in the UC Berkeley Computer
Science Division.  A NOW is composed of a number of high-performance
workstation computers connected by a fast local-area network.  TranSend is
highly-available and fault tolerant, meaning that TranSend will continue to
operate even during the failure of any of the component machines on which
TranSend runs.

<HR>

<a name="how_fast_transend"><H3>How fast is TranSend?</H3></a>

TranSend is a high-performance, scalable service.  An individual
distillation request is satisfied in less than a second, and because TranSend
runs on many machines, a large number of these requests can be processed in
parallel.  What you as a user cares most about is the time it takes the
data to reach you;  this time is split into three components:

<ol>
     <li> <B>The time it takes TranSend to access the data on your
	  behalf.</b>
	  <P>
	  We are using a very large (9GB) web cache that obtains about a 55
	  percent hit rate.  This means about half the time, TranSend
	  already has the data you ask for.  The other half of the time,
	  TranSend must ask remote web servers for the data;  this usually
	  takes less than a second, but for slow web servers (or poor
	  network connectivity to those servers) this could conceivably
	  take many seconds.
	  <P>
     <li> <B>The time it takes TranSend to transform your data.</b>
	  <P>
	  because of our high performance, parallel architecture, it takes
	  TranSend about 50 milliseconds to transform the average web
	  request.  In this sense, TranSend is blazingly fast.
	  <P>
     <li> <B>The time it takes for the data to arrive at your computer once
	  TranSend has send it to you.</B>
	  <P>
	  as you're no doubt aware, this is the bottleneck in the web -
	  sending data over your phone or ISDN is painfully slow.  Because
	  of the image transformation we perform, this bottleneck will be
	  reduced by a factor of 3 to 7 for most data on the web.
</ol>

<HR>

<a name="transend_slow"><H3>TranSend seems slow today.  Why?</H3></a>

More than likely, it is not TranSend itself that is slow.  If you perceive
slow response time, it is most likely because your network connection to
the TranSend server (running at Berkeley) is congested and slow.  If you
are a Berkeley user, your network connection to TranSend is fast, so the
slow response time is probably because of general Internet congestion or
excess load at the web servers that you are visiting.

<HR>

<a name="transend_breaks_page"><H3>TranSend breaks my favourite page. 
        Why? What should I do?</H3></a>

There are three reasons why your favourite page may appear to be broken:

<ol>
     <li> The page is broken on the web server, and TranSend has had no
	  effect on its &quot;brokenness&quot;.  This is most often the
	  case.  The Netscape browser is amazingly good at dealing with
	  broken web pages and doing reasonable things with them;  our
	  TranSend proxy is currently not as good as your browser, which
	  means that some pages that you are used working may no longer
	  work through TranSend.  We are continually improving this aspect
	  of this service.
	  <P>
     <li> The server is unreachable, and TranSend cannot access your data.
	  This happens all-too often on the Internet.  We minimize the
	  possibility of this happening by using our large local cache, but
	  it does still happen.
	  <P>
     <li> There is a bug in TranSend itself.  We know of a few such bugs
	  (check out <a
	  href="http://transend.cs.berkeley.edu/bugs.html">our bug page</a>
	  for a list), and we're working on them.  Bug reports are always
	  appreciated.
</ol>

Try &quot;Reload&quoting the page after having turned of the TranSend
service.  If the problem is resolved, you've found a bug in TranSend -
please <a href="#transend_bugs">report it to us</a>.  If the problem
persists, it is most likely the fault of the web server itself.  Such
problems should be reported to the administrator of that web site.

<HR>

<a name="transend_bugs"><H3>How do I report a bug to the TranSend
        team?</H3></a>

We have a bug reporting email address that you can use.  Please contact
us at:  <P>

<a name="transend_off_break"><H3>I turned off TranSend, but now my web
    surfing seems broken.  What do I do?</H3></a>

More likely than not, your local web cache is polluted with transformed
data.  Go to your options menu, find the web cache options (is it located
in the Network Preferences submenu in Netscape), and clear both your memory
and disk caches.  Resume browsing, and the problem should be resolved.

<HR>

<a name="transend_who"><H3>Who created TranSend?</H3></a>

TranSend was created as part of the <a
href="http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~fox/glomop">GloMop</a> and <a
href="http://daedalus.cs.berkeley.edu">Daedalus</a> research efforts at the
University of California at Berkeley Computer Science Division.  TranSend
was researched, designed, and implemented by graduate students:

<a name="transend_pi"><H3>What is the 9809471'th digit of Pi?</H3></a>

4, of course.  <i>(Editor's note: <b>pi</b> is our favourite TranSendental
number.  We apologize in advance for this awful joke.)</i>
