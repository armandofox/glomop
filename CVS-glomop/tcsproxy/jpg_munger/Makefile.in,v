@kwhilite* files modified for in-class examples. Distill() functionality
in clib.xs still not quite working - this commit will allow me to move
it to purify.  Added stuff to perl_stub makefile so that libperl.so's
directory is added to runtime dynamic lib path.

@various changes to makefiles to support auto-installation into sbin and bin directories.  perl HTML distiller no longer inserts UI in pages with frames.  PREFS_URL and similar strings are now static char* instead of #defines, but still need them to be initialized in PTM stub so distillers can get at them.  "run" targets are better now, they run stuff from the sbin and bin directories.

log
@Many changes to support SDK, including bin and sbin directories,
and modified make targets and names of some binary targets.  Calling
convention changed for perl distillers, so fixed html distiller and
added it as transend.text.html.  monitor.multicast property is now
Monitor.listen; all relevant code was changed.  Monitor can now parse
this from the options file.  Updated all UI changes from branch head.
