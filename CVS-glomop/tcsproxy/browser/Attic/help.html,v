@Moved all browser/ files to wwwroot/ subdirs.  Added miniserver.pl to
eliminate need for separate webserver; notes about it are attached.
2 fixes to dispatch.c logic:
- for server-like dispatch, correct headers are now generated when the
server-mode worker attempts to do a redispatch. (previously, for this
case, the returned headers would be the headers of the original
*request*, not theserver response headers.)
- special-casing for the Prefs form URL was eliminated because it
interferes with the miniserver worker. (Ambiguity arises if a request
both matches the Prefs URL *and* matches the server-mode worker, and
it's ugly to have the miniserver worker special case this.)  Instead,
the miniserver.pl worker does  a redispatch to transend/text/html for
HTML documents, which should catch this case.  this is probably not the
Right Thing long term.

there is a new worker, miniserver.pl, which acts as a very simple
httpd.  the root of its filesystem is {proxy.home}/wwwroot.  note that
it doesn't currently handle cgi's or server-side includes or anything --
all it can do is serve simple static files.

i have made the following changes:

- new submodule tcsproxy/wwwroot, to hold the "support files" for TACC
  apps including transend and wingman.

- moved the existing support files for transend and wingman, including
  the java_gui stuff, from
  tcsproxy/browser to tcsproxy/wwwroot/transend, tcsproxy/wwwroot/wingman,
  and tcsproxy/wwwroot/java_gui, respectively.  tcsproxy/browser is now empty,
  and i will eventually prune it from the tree.

- updated the paths in the html munger transend.text.html to match the
  new structure.

- new perl_dir application miniserver.pl, and new toplevel file
  mime.types (used to map file suffixes to MIME types).  the application
  does in-memory caching and uses stat() to deduce when files need to be
  reloaded, so for local-disk files it shouldn't be too heavy of a
  load.  that the expectation is  that traffic to the wwwroot directory
   will be modest - this worker would suck for running a high-traffic
  server, since it doesn't bound the size of the in-memory cache or attempt
  to manage memory to keep "hot" items nearby as Harvest does.


the easiest way to make this mechanism work:

- add an entry to your options file:

        dist.myurl/dispatch: sbin/perl_stub -- perl_dir/miniserver.pl

- set frontend.aggString to the prefix of URL's that should be served
  from the "fake" web server.

- be sure frontend.webServerName matches frontend.aggString.  (this is
  necessary because frontend.webServerName is used by workers that want
  to access the "support files".  keeping these two properties separate
  leaves the option of running a separate web server if desired.)

- *** IMPORTANT *** because miniserver doesn't handle forms submission
   in any way, the frontend.prefsFormSubmitURL property must be
   constructed so that it DOES NOT MATCH anything that might be
   requested of miniserver.  this isn't so bad when you remember that
   the prefsFormSubmitUrl can be a totally imaginary server.
   UNFORTUNATELY, the file wwwroot/transend/prefs.html, which is the
   prefs-submission form, has to have some name wired into it; i picked
   "http://transend-prefs.cs.berkeley.edu", so that's what the config
   files will need to say for now.  i know this is kind of hacky.

-  note that for text/html files, miniserver.pl will redispatch to
   transend/text/html; for other files it will do nothing, ie just
   return the file.  i'm not sure this is the right thing all the time,
   though it's certainly right for transend (causes user prefs form to
   be filled in with existing prefs values).

<H3>TranSend Proxy Overview:</H3>
When you are browsing using the TranSend proxy, you will notice
several changes.  A description of these changes is provided below:<P>

<STRONG>Distilled Images:</STRONG>  The proxy distills an image by
reducing its quality.  Although all images you see will be degraded,
you have the option of seeing the original image (See Refining Images
below).  For images that are links, you will also notice a little
symbol placed next to the image; this symbol is a link to the original
image.<P>

<STRONG>Faster Loading:</STRONG>  The result of using the TranSend
Proxy to distill images is faster web browsing.  You will see a
significant improvement in loading speed for web pages that have
images.<P>

<STRONG>TranSend Logo:</STRONG>  The TranSend logo will appear on all
web pages that you visit.  This logo will be located in the
upper-right-hand corner of the page and is a link to the TranSend Proxy
Settings page.  Clicking on the logo will take you to the page where
you can set personal proxy preferences. 
</TD></TR><TD WIDTH=100% ALIGN=left>

<H3>Refining Images:</H3>
When using the proxy, the images you see may not be of their highest
quality.  However, if you would like to view a certain image in its
original, undegraded form, you can refine the image.  To do this,
click on the image, or if the image is a link, click on the symbol next
to the image.  
</TD></TR><TD WIDTH=100% ALIGN=left>

<H3>Setting Personal Preferences:</H3>
To go to the settings page, click on the TranSend logo located at the
upper-left-hand corner of each page you visit.  Once you arrive at the
settings page, you can set the following preferences:

<UL>
  <LI>Enable Proxy
  <LI>Image Quality vs. Loading Speed
  <LI>Display Logo
</UL>

A description of each of these preferences is provided below:<P>

<STRONG>Enable Proxy Setting:</STRONG>  This setting allows you to turn
the proxy on and off.  For faster web browsing, it is recommended that
you keep this setting on.<P>

<STRONG>Image Quality vs. Loading Speed Setting:</STRONG>  This
setting allows you to select the level of quality for your
images. However, to obtain faster loading speeds, some image quality
must be sacrificed. <P>

<STRONG>Display Logo Setting:</STRONG>  This setting allows you to
choose whether you want the TranSend logo to appear on the top of each
web page.  For easy access to the settings page, it is recommended
that you keep this setting on.
If you have disabled the logo, the preferences page can be found at
<a href="http://transend.cs.berkeley.edu/prefs.html">http://transend.cs.berkeley.edu/prefs.html</a>.<P>

After you have entered your preferences, click on the "Submit
preferences" button and your  preferences will begin taking effect.
Also, if you want to reset your settings to their previous values,
click on the "Reset to previous settings" button.
</TD></TR><TD WIDTH=100% ALIGN=left>

<H3>Reporting Bugs:</H3>
To report bugs or send comments, go to the settings page by clicking
on the TranSend logo.  At the bottom of the settings page, you will
find a section to mail comments.  Type in your email address, subject,
and any comments you have.  Then click on the "Mail comments" button
to send your message.   We have a list of known bugs
<a href="bugs.html">here</A>.
