@http header parsing distinguishes http version and method. minor fixes to config files.

@Research contributions of this proxy:

- Avoiding receiver livelock
  distiller load metric: queue lengths, memory used for buffering queue,

- Avoiding having a thread suspended while it's in the GAM critical
  section
        probabilistic? non-blocking synch.?

- heterogeneous tasks with varying loads

- GAM + Fast Sockets is good not only because of bandwidth and short
        path, but because you essentially get LRP elements.  (compare
        performance using neither; scheduling problem resulting in
        livelock, along with badness from long interrupt times being
        charged to interrupted GAM process.)


Differentiations from other systems (eg Calypso):

- optimized to be an internet server
            network scheduling
            heterogeneous remote threads
            external-event driven
            partitioned cache support

- specific abstractions for infrastructure computing
           persistent user profiles
           session state
           worker load balancing
           load reporting and remote control
           flexible work queue that any worker can access (not yet)

Pervasive throughout:

- make the common case fast, the uncommon case correct
  Ex: preallocate memory for "commonly sized" requests, but fall back to
  malloc for bigger ones.  done for http headers, gifmunch, etc

- exploit temporal locality
  Ex: wherever a lookup is involved, esp. if a system call is involved,
  keep a cache of most recent 3-4 values.  e.g. in matching user prefs
  to ip address.
