tsform.html contains a basic forms-based user interface. The 
page contains two forms, one for setting preferences and one 
for sending comments.

Here are some details on the first form which is used for 
setting preferences:

	- HIDDEN INPUT TYPES:

	  When a checkbox is selected, the form will send
	  some value (0 or 1) for the given name. However,
	  the desired behavior is to have the form send
	  the opposite value when the checkbox is not clicked.

	  To accomplish this, "hidden" inputs are used.  Let's
	  say the checkbox is to set the value for "i1." The
	  non-checked value is set using a hidden input 
	  before the checkbox input. This way, if nothing is
	  checked, the value set by the hidden input (which is
	  the desired non-checked value) is sent.

	- TRANSENDID and TRANSENDVAL:

	  These two keywords are used by the proxy to make
	  the proxy settings page show up with the user's
	  current settings. Depending on the user's settings
	  the proxy will either do nothing with these keywords
	  or will replace them with the word CHECKED.

	- INPUT NAME="i7"

	  This hidden input is used by the proxy to indicate
	  which form is being sent. In this case, the value
	  is set to 0 to indicate the beginner's settings form.

Here are some details on the first form which is used for 
sending comments:

	- This form posts to a cgi-bin that processes the
	  input and forwards a message to the specified
	  address.
