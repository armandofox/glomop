@/*
 * Arguments that all distillers (as well as the frontend) can possibly 
 * understand.
 *
 * FRONT_NO_DISTILL - integer argument
 *      If this argument is <> 0 then the distiller should not distill this
 *      request.
 *
 * FRONT_RESIZE - integer argument
 *      If this argument <> 0 then the distiller should resize any
 *      item that might be shruken, such as an image.  This argument
 *      won't be set by a user, but rather by the HTML distiller when
 *      it detects that an IMG tag has no width/height attributes.
 *      The distiller can either resize data back to the original, or
 *      not play with sizes at all and just crank on the quality knob.
 *
 * FRONT_MTU - the payload MTU for the user's network (e.g. 1500 or so
 *      for PPP).  In general, if content is less than this big, it
 *      doesn't pay to distill.
 *
 * FRONT_RETRY_DISTILL - the number of times to retry a distillation if the
 *      return code is distConnectionBroken (indicating distiller coredumped or
 *      died). This should be bounded, in order to avoid systematic killing of
 *      a distiller by the same request repeatedly.
 *
 * FRONT_QUALITY - this integer argument represents the "abstract"
 *      quality of an image, from (1,5) inclusive.  (1 is low/fast,
 *      5 is high/slow).
 *
 * FRONT_SHOW_ICON - controls user interface for quality-setting and refinement:
 *      0 - no visible user interface on pages
 *      1 - show Java dashboard (which uses Javascript "refine all")
 *      2 - show TranSend icon that links to Prefs page
 *
 * FRONT_EXPERT - if nonzero, the user is using the expert interface
 *
 * FRONT_ISMAP  - is an imagemap
 *
 * FRONT_BYPASS_TRANS - bypass transparencies
 *
 * FRONT_CLIENT_IP - INT32 representation of client IP address
 *
 * FRONT_USERID - short string, user ID of this user.  If nonempty, the
 *      distiller is chosen by prepending this name plus colon to the MIME
 *      type.  Username 'transend' are the system distillers, which are used if
 *      this arg is not given or empty string.
 *
 * FRONT_NOCACHE - integer - if present and value is 1, then send a no-cache
 *      to the server for this page and all inlines fetched from this page.
 *      If absent or 0, don't do anything special.
 *
 * FRONT_CLI_VERSION - integer - a code respresenting the client version, so
 *      we can do some things only for some client versions
 *
 * FRONT_DEVELOPER - integer - if nonzero, the user is a developer and we
 *      should explicitly report distiller routing errors, distiller not found,
 *      etc. rather than trying to mask it.
 *
 * FRONT_SRCFLAG - integer - if 1, view the "raw" version of this document
 *                           if 2, view the raw version as a Doc file
 *                           if 0, view the processed version

@changes and additions to transend.text.piml (pilot markup language html
distiller).  commented the ARGS.h file for distillers.  distillers now
only observe Quality arg if it has a reasonable value.  Changes to main
prefs to make values of FRONT_SHOW_ICON arg agree with perl html distiller.

1.12
log
@various changes to makefiles to support auto-installation into sbin and bin directories.  perl HTML distiller no longer inserts UI in pages with frames.  PREFS_URL and similar strings are now static char* instead of #defines, but still need them to be initialized in PTM stub so distillers can get at them.  "run" targets are better now, they run stuff from the sbin and bin directories.

@Many changes to support SDK, including bin and sbin directories,
and modified make targets and names of some binary targets.  Calling
convention changed for perl distillers, so fixed html distiller and
added it as transend.text.html.  monitor.multicast property is now
Monitor.listen; all relevant code was changed.  Monitor can now parse
this from the options file.  Updated all UI changes from branch head.

@Fixed pref page bugs on html form; changed ICON_STRING in html munger to
position top-right and force clear at both margins.  ie prefs retrieval
and setting now works correctly.  still to do: ICON_STRING needs to
reflect correct url to prefs (transend.cs...etc), along with arg that
means "don't show the logo on that page" and "don't distill anything on
that page".
