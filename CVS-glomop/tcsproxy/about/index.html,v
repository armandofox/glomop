<h1 align="center">The TranSend Service</h1>

<i>NOTE:  If you are visiting this page through the TranSend proxy, the
images on this page will be distilled, even though they are snapshots of
distilled images!  Turn off distillation to see these images as they were
intended.</i>

<h2>What is TranSend?</h2>

TranSend is a <i>transformational proxy service</i> running at the
<a href="http://www.cs.berkeley.edu">Computer Science Division</a> of
the
<a href="http://www.berkeley.edu">University of California at Berkeley</a>.
The purpose of TranSend is to
make web surfing a more pleasurable experience for the campus dial-in
&quot;home IP&quot; population by eliminating the long wait times that
students, staff, and faculty usually experience while downloading web
content over modems.

<p>

<ul>
     <li> TranSend is
	  <b>transformational</b> because it transforms web data into
	  a representation that is better suited to the needs and constraints
	  of the end user.  If the end user is surfing the web over a slow
	  modem or wireless link, then the large images that are often
	  found on the web dominate the download time of web content.  A
	  recent study performed at Berkeley showed that although most
	  items fetched from the web are small (around 1KB), most bytes
	  transferred to users come from large images (10KB and up).  This
	  is exactly the worst situation - the user ends up wasting most of
	  her time waiting for a small number of large images.
	  <p>
	  Alternatively, if the user is surfing the web from a constrained
	  device such as a Personal Digital Assistant (PDA), most pages and
	  images are too large to fit on a screen, and may even contain
	  content that the device cannot render (such as progressive JPEG
	  data).
	  <p>
	  TranSend eliminates these difficulties by transforming data to a
	  more reasonable form - by throwing away image resolution or color
	  information and by transcoding data (images or text) into formats
	  the end device can understand.

	  <p>

	  For example, the following 39.3 KB GIF image of Vancouver,
	  Canada can be found on the web:
	  <p>
	  <center>
	  <img src="sunset.gif" WIDTH=309 HEIGHT=206>
	  </center>
	  <p>
	  Over a 28.8 modem, this image would take at least 11 seconds to
	  download;  over a 14.4 modem, it would take 22 seconds or more.
	  The TranSend proxy takes approximately 30 milliseconds to
	  transform this image;  the default transformation (which converts
	  the GIF into a JPEG, throws away half the resolution, and turns
	  the &quot;quality&quot; knob of the JPEG down to 75%) results in
	  the following image:
	  <p>
	  <center>
	  <img src="sunset_2.jpg" WIDTH=309 HEIGHT=206>
	  </center>
	  <p>
	  The transformed image is of slightly poorer quality, but is only
	  3.9 KB in size.  This translates into a 1 second download
          time over a 28.8 modem (2 seconds over 14.4), or a <b>factor of 10
          improvement</B> in speed!

          <p>

          Users can explicitly control the aggressiveness of this
          transformation (which we call &quot;distillation&quot;), and
          can also retrieve untransformed data if they want.  In this
          way, TranSend gives users the opportunity to spend a small
          amount of time getting reasonable representations of data, and
          then make an educated decision about whether or not to spend
          additional time retrieving the high quality data.
          <p>
          Examples of different transformation aggressiveness for the
          following image of an eagle:
<table border>

<tr>
<td><img src="eagle.jpg" width=117 height=117></td>
<td><B>10.3 KB original</b></td>
<td><img src="eagle1.jpg" width=117 height=117></td>
<td>5.6 KB version</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><img src="eagle2.jpg" width=117 height=117></td>
<td>3.5 KB version</td>
<td><img src="eagle3.jpg" width=117 height=117></td>
<td>2.5 KB version</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><img src="eagle4.jpg" width=117 height=117></td>
<td>2.0 KB version</td>
<td><img src="eagle5.jpg" width=117 height=117></td>
<td>1.6 KB version</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><img src="eagle6.jpg" width=117 height=117></td>
<td>1.1 KB version</td>
<td><img src="eagle7.jpg" width=117 height=117></td>
<td>0.8 KB (unrecognizable) version</td>

</tr>

</table>

<P>

     <li> TranSend is
	  <b>a proxy</b> because it sits in between users' web browsers and
	  the web servers on the Internet.  When a user tells her web
	  browser to fetch a page, the browser contacts TranSend and acts
	  it for the page (instead of going directly to the server).
	  TranSend then fetches the data (either out of a local cache or
	  from the server itself), transforms the data based on a user
	  preference profile that the user has created of herself, and
	  returns the transformed data to the user in lieu of the original
	  data.  It is this &quot;middleman&quot; nature that makes
	  TranSend a web proxy.

	  <p>
	  
     <li> TranSend is
	  <b>a service</b> because this on-demand transformation
	  is available to a large number of Berkeley students, staff, and
	  faculty 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.  Being up and running 24x7
	  is called being <i>highly available</i>;  this availability is
	  achieved through fault tolerance methods - if any component of
	  the TranSend service fails (such as would happen if one of the
	  machines on which it is running crashes), TranSend adapts to this
	  failure either by shunting work away from the crashed components
	  by attempting to automatically restart the component.  TranSend
	  is also <i>scalable</i>, which means if the demand for the
	  service increases, we can add more resources (CPUs, disks,
	  memory, or network) to TranSend, growing the service to meet the
	  demands.
	  
</ul>

<h2>How much benefit do I get from TranSend?</h2>

The following web downloads were performed using a Gateway 2000 P133
running Linux 2.0.27 and Netscape Navigator 3.0.  Network connectivity was
using a Ricochet wireless modem (approximately 20-30 Kb/s).  Five pages
were chosen as a fairly representative set of pages from the Internet;
specifically, a mixture of graphics and text intensive pages were picked in
order to give an idea of the experience a user will have using TranSend.
