@OPTIMIZATIONS/FEATURES

Determine whether it makes sense to convert an image to jpeg/pjpeg based
on the effective bpp of the encoding.

Use LOWSRC to allow a limited amount of client choreographing of
communication.  I.e. for images converted to JPEG, the tag should say
SRC="foo_original.pjpg" LOWSRC="foo_distilled.jpg", ie the LOWSRC is a
low quality jpg.

DESIGN

As far as CPU resources permit, do distillation for each request.
When CPU resources don't permit, satisfy request by picking a "nearby"
representation from cache, if available.
If that fails, tunnel original.

Do all renaming via URL munging: modify IMG SRC= tags in HTML to avoid
client pollution.  Given a "distillation granularity" N and URL
namespace U, you can build a namespace UxN for the distilled URL's.

Granularity: suppose distillation granularity was N, and at time t=t0,
it becomes M which is coarser than N.  For times t<<t0, the cache is
caching URL's from namespace UxN; for times t>>t0, it is caching URL's
from namespace UxM.  In the interim, requests will probably still arrive
(due to client-cached HTML) for namespace UxN which will end up missing
the cache even though an "nearly equivalent" representation in namespace
UxM is in the cache.  But Steve points out this condition is transient-
it only occurs when client cache contains HTML and not images, and that
situation is rare.

ARCHITECTURE

Control point is always closest to the client.  "Partitioned Harvests"
are off to one side.

- HTML request: retrieve original HTML from Harvest or server; hand off
to an HTML distiller to munge the IMG tags and do other stuff.  If
retrieve from server, allow original HTML to be stored in Harvest, but
never stored munged HTML.

- Anything else: URL from client will already be munged, so do direct
lookup in Harvest first, and return what you find if a hit; otherwise
delegate to a distiller to get orig. from server, distill according to
parameters in the munged URL, deliver munged version into cache, and
return it.  (Do we cache original, and if so, how does it get there?)

- Partition cache across several Harvest's.  Proxy front-end hashes URL
to determine which Harvest to query for a URL.  For multiple
representations, try to design hashing so that multiple representations
of the same object will hash to different Harvest's; then you can poll
all caches in parallel, and return the "best" representation from among
the hits.

Distillers will run on "all" available machines.  They will be added
and deleted dynamically in response to changing load; TBD.  The PxFE
maintains a working list of distillers it knows about and communicates
with them using a custom ActiveMessages-based protocol.  New distillers
must notify each PxFE as they come up; if a connection to a distiller
fails, it's removed from that PxFE's list.

May be more efficient to have only one kind of distiller running on a
given machine; this also may allow allocating machines to reflect
distillation latency, i.e. 1 HTML distiller per 10 image munchers, etc.
Probably a heuristic, since under certain conditions 1 machine may be
enough to support several other distillers with its spare cycles.


SIMULATIONS/MEASUREMENTS

- locality of "institutional" caches; compare to user traces
  (Glassman DEC SRC cache, UK natl cache, NZ cache, BU traces)
- UK,NZ cache papers measure cache performance in bytes saved, not hit rate.
- expected "steady state" load levels for N users as seen at cache
  (given, say, 10MB client cache)

INTERESTING REGIONS OF OPERATION:

                         /
     |               ___/
     |            __/   .
   T |    _______/      .
     |   /.             .
     |  / .             .
     | /  .             .
     |/   .             .
     /------------------.---------
       A           B       C
   offered load, distil requests/sec


T is a target latency for satisfying user requests; for sufficiently
fast distillers, T is dominated by queueing delay, not CPU cycles.

Region A: offered load easily handled by deployed distillers, with
cycles to spare.  (Can use those cycles for other stuff?  eg
prefetching, "predistilling")

Region B: load approaches threshold T beyond which distiller queues grow
without bound, so must satisfy requests from cache only.  Can
either try to keep system in that region, *or* add more machines running
addl distillers (thereby raising T, and putting you back in region A).

Region C: system is either I/O bound w/respect to all wide-area entry
points, or compute or I/O bound w/r/t Harvest cache or proxy front-end.
(i.e. you're hosed)

Entering/leaving region B has to have some hysteresis.
E.g. periodically snapshot the sizes of the distiller queues (have
distillers piggyback state info on every k'th request).  Transitions
between regions are confirmed after M consecutive snapshots that place
the system in that region.  It is left to determine how to choose M.



OPTIMIZATIONS/HACKS to HARVEST

- how do you "push" something into the cache?
- increase timeout to parent, to give proxy time to get & distill stuff
- Fast Sockets (active msgs) for UDP calls to siblings
- cache partitioning among siblings, rather than "full replication"
- dynamically add/remove siblings

AXES

- image format: pjpg with jpg lowsrc, or gif
- color depth: log2(4,16,256)
- scale, subject to (maxx,maxy) constraint; 1/k of total area for k>=2.
  (implies approximately 1/k bytes, modulo compression, etc.)

THINGS TO INVESTIGATE

- how does H parent relay big content to H? if model is UDP to ask
parent but parent opens TCP to send stuff back, can just forward this
info to distiller and have it send content directly back to H.
- cost of GIF->JPG or PJPG
- single-user Web traces to estimate Harvest hit rate

HACKING TO BE DONE

- more efficient distillers: giftogif, giftopjpeg (threaded?)
- nonblocking LWP

Architecture: a subset of NOW will be "control points".  Each CP runs a
proxy FE and a Harvest.  The H is the HTTP proxy, the FE its parent.
All H's are siblings; we expect this will be at most a couple of tens of
Harvest's.  H doesn't partition cache among siblings - that's an
optimization for later.  The Harvest and PxFE communicate using the
Harvest cache protocol (they could also use HTTP, but
who wants to?).

FLOW

H gets client request, checks siblings.  If fail, then:
H asks proxy (parent)
  Proxy fetches from Internet
  Consults user prefs
  Computes distill params, picks a distiller
  Forwards content and H listening endpoint info to distiller; gets
             out of the way
    Distiller distills content, forwards to H
H caches content and responds to client

Granularity: what if it was N, and now it becomes M which is coarser
than N?  This means a request G(N_0) will miss cache even if cache could
satisfy G(M_0), beacuse of namespace independence.  But Steve points out
this condition is transient- it only occurs when client cache contains
HTML and not images, and that situation is rare.
