@Modified distiller side code for instrumentation
Added stuff to the frontend side code to do predicting of the queue length

! Each line in the distillers database has the following format:
!       <distiller-type>: <executable-path> \
!                        [<auto-launch-limit-ms> [<averaging-interval-ms> \
!                         [<notification-interval-ms>]]]
!       currently the auto-launch-limit-ms param is the max tolerable queue 
!       length. Set it to zero if you want to disable auto-launching

@Major changes to the PTM. The PTM can now auto-launch new distillers when
the load on the system gets too high. The frontend stub has a separate
thread per connection to the distillers and PTM to handle network events
