1.11
log
@various changes to makefiles to support auto-installation into sbin and bin directories.  perl HTML distiller no longer inserts UI in pages with frames.  PREFS_URL and similar strings are now static char* instead of #defines, but still need them to be initialized in PTM stub so distillers can get at them.  "run" targets are better now, they run stuff from the sbin and bin directories.

1.10
log
@Many changes to support SDK, including bin and sbin directories,
and modified make targets and names of some binary targets.  Calling
convention changed for perl distillers, so fixed html distiller and
added it as transend.text.html.  monitor.multicast property is now
Monitor.listen; all relevant code was changed.  Monitor can now parse
this from the options file.  Updated all UI changes from branch head.

@Changes, including some HACKS in dispatch.c, to support aggregator behavior.  New doc file explaining how to write them, but its out of date.  sample aggregators and new stuff in TACCutils.pm.  different syntax for specifying distillers/aggregators.
