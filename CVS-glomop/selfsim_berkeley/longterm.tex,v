@\section{Lack of Long-Term Self-Similarity in File Systems}\label{longterm}

Self-similarity by definition spans all time scales, so file system traffic
over very long periods should still exhibit self-similar behaviour.
However, as we demonstrate in this section, the self-similarity appears to
break down at time scales in the neighbourhood of a day to a week.  We saw
some evidence of this in figure \ref{vis_demo_ss} when the INS trace became
less bursty and more predictable at these time scales.  We demonstrate this
more convincingly here using variance-time analysis.

\subsection{Variance-time Analysis of Long-Term Trace Data}

\caption{{\bf Variance-time plots:} these plots clearly demonstrate a
substantial change in traffic characteristics at a time scale between
$10^4$ and $10^5$ seconds per bucket, i.e. at the day to week long time
scale. The first two figures (a) and (b) are of INS trace events, and the
second is of the UMBC trace events.  (d) is a reproduced figure from
a published paper on self-similarity in World Wide Web traffic
\cite{crov95}.}
\label{crovella_www_ss}
\end{center}
\end{figure*}

Figure \ref{crovella_www_ss} shows the variance-time plots from three
different traces.  Figure \ref{crovella_www_ss}(a) and (b) illustrate all
and open file system events from the INS trace, respectively.  Figure
\ref{crovella_www_ss}(c) shows all file system events from the UMBC trace.
In all three plots, we can see that for fine-grained time scales, a linear
relationship can be observed with a slope in the range $-1.0 < m < 0$,
indicating self-similarity.  However, at time scales approaching a day,
this linear relationship breaks down, as evidenced by the ``knees'' in each
curve.

This effect can also be observed in previously published work.  In figure
\ref{crovella_www_ss}(d) we have replicated a previously published
variance-time plot from \cite{crov95} that illustrates self-similarity in
world wide web traffic.  This effect of non-linearity can be observed here;
the plot just begins to fall off of the straight line as the dataset's time
scales are exhausted.  We hypothesize that if another order of magnitude of
trace data had been analyzed, this effect would have been unmistakable.

This evidence, in combination with the visual confirmation of a smoothing
out of the burstiness of the long-term traffic in figure \ref{vis_demo_ss},
leads us to the conclusion that file system traffic is observably {\bf not
self-similar}---the burstiness of the traffic simply does not uniformly
extend across all time scales.  This is completely reasonable and
intuitive: human behaviour dominates the traffic at the day through week
level, as evidenced by the traces' unmistakably diurnal cycle.  Across
several weeks and months, there is some burstiness, but the burstiness is
limited in scale and far less frequent than at short time scales.  For such
short time scales, however, the file system traffic is well-represented by
a self-similar process, but for long time scales, self-similarity does not
give a good representation of the traffic.

In \cite{Lips96}, an analysis of a subset of heavy-tailed
distributions\footnote{A heavy-tailed distribution is typically one which
exhibits infinite variance.  An example of a heavy-tailed distribution is
the Pareto distribution, whose general form is $P(x) = \beta a^\beta
x^{-\beta-1}$ with $a,\beta \geq 0$ and $x \geq a$.  The Pareto
distribution has infinite variance for values of $\beta < 1$.}  known as
{\it Power-tail} distributions is presented.  This work argues that the
self-similarity identified in systems (including the Ethernet traffic from
\cite{Lela94}) can be explained by an arrival process with such a
power-tail distribution.  Power-tail distributions do obey the central
limit theorem, but only for extremely large aggregation
values. \cite{Lips96} argues that Leland et al. would have observed their
traffic instability to smooth out if only they had increased the time scale
of their analysis by another 2 orders of magnitude to a total of 7.

In comparison, our INS traces ostensibly span a total of more than 6 orders
of magnitude.  The INS traces are unique in that they afforded us the
possibility of observing such a wide time range of trace data that it
resulted us in observing the cessation of the self-similar behaviour.

already been been performed on the data, since the granularity of the
traces is 1 second and the granularity of the traced system calls is on the
order of milliseconds.  Thus, the INS traces are unique in that they
afforded us the possibility of observing more than 9 orders of magnitude of
trace time scales.  We believe that it is this wide time range of our trace
data that resulted us in observing the cessation of the self-similar

Despite these drawbacks, the long-term traces provide a coarse-grained look
at file system activity.  Post-processing the trace files generated
detailed long-term statistics for file accesses, modifications, creations,
deletions, and other high-level file activity. \cite{gibs98} The U**** file
system trace data is summarized in table \ref{ustar_summary}.

While the U**** data is disparate from the Sprite and NFS data, if file
system traffic is truly self-similar, then the U**** data should also be
self-similar.  Showing that self-similarity is present in both short-term
and long-term file system traces is important, because if short-term data
demonstrates self-similarity, then evidence of this self-similarity should
be present in long-term data as well.\cite{mand83}

\subsection{Detecting Self-Similarity}\label{detect_selfsim_long}

The more data that one has available, the easier it is to detect
self-similarity. However, it is possible to analyze data for
self-similarity with only several hundred data points. \cite{hast93,pet96}
The Sprite and NFS traces provide hundreds of thousands of measurements to
analyze. The U**** traces only provide 287 data points, so different
techniques must be used to analyze them. For example, using the
variance-time plot with a few hundred data points produces a very sparse
plot with large variations and no clearly distinguishable trends.

a 287 day period, and is plotted on a Z-scale.}\label{zvis}
d61 36
a96 38
The key difference between self-similar patterns and random patterns is
that the former must have a trend. The trend in the U**** data is shown in
figure \ref{zvis}.  To show these trends we use a technique called
Z-scaling, where the data is shown in relationship to its own mean and
standard deviation \cite{adams95}.  To better illustrate the pattern, both
the overall file system activity and the same data randomly rearranged is
shown. Parts a and b of the figure show the true data and the random data
in a Z-scale plot. The randomized data is clearly more jagged. Parts c and
d of figure \ref{zvis} show the data from parts a and b cumulatively. The
trend from the real data in part c of the figure is readily apparent, while
the randomized data shows no pattern. More significantly, the randomized
data stays relatively close to the zero standard deviation mark, while the
real data has large standard deviations. The latter is expected with
self-similar traffic because of the large variances in the data.

\subsection{R/S Analysis}

Having visually established a trend in the long-term data, the next step is
to see if the trend is self-similar.  It is difficult to accurately use
variance-time plots with only a few hundred data points. However,
estimating the Hurst parameter using R/S analysis is possible with this
amount of data, but the resulting estimate is not as accurate as with a
larger data set.\cite{hast93,pet96}

  %%%%% Figure 2
% is a plot of the
%R/S analysis of the total system activity and the randomized activity used
%as a basis for the Z-scale plots in figure \ref{zvis}.
%The randomized data is included as a comparison. 
%The estimated Hurst parameter for the randomized data should be closer to 0.5
%than the regular data; as %%%Figure 2 shows, 
%this is correct. The estimated
%Hurst parameter for overall file system activity on the U**** system is
%0.7326, while the randomized data's value is 0.5768.

We estimated the Hurst parameter using R/S analysis for all of the file
system activities on the U**** file systems; the results of these R/S
analysis are summarized in table \ref{ustar_hurst}.

\end{tabular}
\caption{{\bf U**** R/S H estimates}}
\label{ustar_hurst}
\end{table}
\end{footnotesize}

All of the estimated Hurst parameters for the long-term data are well
above 0.5.  As with the short-term data, this is an indicator of
self-similar activity.  By way of comparison, the Pox plot estimate for
Sprite deletions -- one of the few file system actions that directly match
between the short and long-term traces -- is 0.7463.  However, this close
correlation between the two systems may be a coincidence, and furthermore the
two values' confidence intervals don't overlap.
 
To summarize, we have shown through an analysis of long-term (but
coarse-granularity) file system data that burstiness and
self-similarity do indeed persist across large time scales.  The
fine-grained trace analysis in section \ref{measure_sec} demonstrated
self-similarity up to a time period of 40 hours, while the analysis of the
long-term traces in this section demonstrate self-similarity over a time
period of 287 days.  Some differences between the two analysis are to be
expected since the traces were collected on different systems.  However, the
important conclusion that can be drawn from all three sets of traces is
they all demonstrated self-similar file system activity.

The long-term traces we analyze in this section were collected daily on a
portion of the University of Maryland, Baltimore County's file systems to
generate data for a tape-migration simulation.  The tracing period spanned
287 days. These traces were not collected with kernel modifications;
instead, a modified version of the ``find'' utility was run nightly to
collect information from a number of file systems in the University.

This tracing process did not provide the fine-grained data the Sprite and
NFS traces possess - the tape-migration simulator did not require such
fine-grained measurements.  For example, on the Sprite system traces, a user
modifying a file will generate an open, a close, and many intervening
reads and writes. The U**** traces only show one action, a file
modification. Thus, the long-term traces collapse many events into
one. Similarly, the trace collection process does not track how many times
a file is used during a day.  Finally, it misses all the temporary files the
system creates and deletes during the day - Ousterhout \cite{oust85}
noted that 80\% of all file creations have a lifetime of less than three
minutes; all of these are missed.
