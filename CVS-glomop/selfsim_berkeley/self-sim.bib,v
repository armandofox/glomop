     the literature. These findings give rise to novel and challenging
     problems in traffic engineering for high-speed networks and open
     up new areas of research in queueing and performance analysis
     involving long-range dependent traffic models. A small number of

         investigating a number of wide-area TCP arrival processes
         (session and connection arrivals, FTPDATA connection arrivals
         within FTP sessions, and TELNET packet arrivals) to determine
         the error introduced by modeling them using Poisson
         processes. We find that user-initiated TCP session arrivals,
         such as remote-login and file-transfer, are well-modeled as
         Poisson processes with fixed hourly rates, but that other
         connection arrivals deviate considerably from Poisson; that
         modeling TELNET packet interarrivals as exponential
         grievously underestimates the burstiness of TELNET traffic,
         but using the empirical Tcplib(DJCME92) interarrivals
         preserves burstiness over many time scales; and that FTPDATA
         connection arrivals within FTP sessions come bunched into
         "connection bursts", the largest of which are so large that
         they completely dominate FTPDATA traffic. Finally, we offer

		  A log-structured file system writes all

		  crash recovery.  The log is the only structure on
		  disk;  it contains indexing information so that
		  files can be read back from the log efficiently.  In
		  order to maintain large free areas on disk for fast
		  writing, we divide the log into segments and use a
		  segment cleaner to compress the live information
		  from heavily fragmented segments.  We present a
		  series of simulations that demonstrate the
		  efficiency of a simple cleaning policy based on cost
		  and benefit.  We have implemented a prototype
		  log-structured file system called Sprite LFS;  it
		  outperforms current Unix file systems by an order of
		  magnitude for small-file writes while matching or
		  exceeding Unix performance for reads and large
		  writes.  Even when the overhead for cleaning is
		  included, Sprite LFS can use 70% of the disk
		  bandwidth for writing, whereas Unix file systems
		  typically can use only 5-10%.} }
