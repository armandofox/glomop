@\section{Self-Similarity in File Systems (Short-term)}\label{measure_sec}

In this section, we demonstrate using rigorous statistical techniques the
presence of self-similar behaviour in the two short-term file system
traces (Sprite and Auspex NFS).  The two techniques that we use are
variance-time plots, and R/S analysis.

\subsection{Variance-time plots}\label{variance_plots}

We can take advantage of equation \ref{variance-aggregation} to
more rigorously verify the self-similar nature of a
process, and to estimate the value of the Hurst parameter $H$.
Taking the logarithm of both sides of the equation results in the
relation
\begin{equation}
 \log\left({\displaystyle Var}\left(X^{(m)}\right)\right) = c_1
- \beta\log\left(m\right)
\end{equation}
for some constant $c_1$.  Thus, plotting $\log\left({\displaystyle
Var}\left(X^{(m)}\right)\right)$ versus $\log\left(m\right)$ for many
values of $m$ of a self-similar process will result in a linear series
of points with slope $-\beta$;  this plot is known as a {\it
variance-time plot}.

file open events and (b) NFS file open (W) events are illustrated, and
linear curve fits displayed.}\label{varplots}
\end{figure}

Given a variance-time plot, an estimate of $H$ can be obtained by
calculating the slope $\beta$ and using equation \ref{beta-H}.  Slopes
between -2 and 0 correspond to Hurst parameters $H$ between 0.5 and 1;
if $0.5 < H < 1$, then the process is self-similar.  Figure
\ref{varplots} illustrates the variance-time plot for Sprite file open
events (\ref{varplots}a) and NFS file open (W) events (\ref{varplots}b).
Both are extremely linear, and have Hurst parameters of 0.874 and 0.749,
respectively.  This verifies the self-similar nature of these processes.

\caption{{\bf Estimates of $H$:} This table
summarizes the estimated values of the Hurst parameters $H$ derived
from variance-time and pox plots of the Sprite and NFS trace data.}
\label{var_summary}
\end{table*}
\end{footnotesize}

Variance-time plots were generated for all of the events listed in table
\ref{trace_summary}; the resulting Hurst parameter estimates are listed in
table \ref{var_summary}.  In all cases except for open and close (RW)
events within the NFS traces, all estimated Hurst parameters are well above
0.5, indicating that specific file system event types exhibit
self-similarity across short time scales.  The two cases for which the
estimated Hurst parameter is low (NFS open and close events with RW
privileges) correspond to events for which scant amounts of trace data were
available (refer to table \ref{trace_summary}).  These two estimated Hurst
parameters are thus unreliable.

Somewhat surprisingly, the estimated values of $H$ for the 1991 Sprite file
system events seem to match their 1994 NFS counterparts.  For example, the
estimated value of 0.8734 for Sprite open events is quite close to the NFS
open (R) value of 0.8413, although it is greater than the NFS open for
write (W) and open read/write (RW) values of 0.7491 and 0.5286,
respectively.  Considering that the number of NFS open read (R) events
dominate the NFS open (W) and open (RW) events, this is not unreasonable.
However, as indicated by the confidence intervals on these $H$ estimates,
the differences between the NFS and Sprite values are statistically
significant.

Unsurprisingly, the measured Hurst parameters for open events closely match
the measured values for close events.  Open events are quickly followed by
close events; the open and close event processes should therefore be
equally bursty and asymptotically self-similar.

\subsection{R/S-Analysis and Pox plots}\label{pox_plots}

A second estimate of the Hurst parameter can be obtained through R/S
analysis (originally presented in \cite{Mand69}, and fully explained in
\cite{Bera95}).  Given a set of observations
$(X_k : k = 1, 2, \ldots, N)$, that set is subdivided into $K$ disjoint,
contiguous subsets of length $(N/K)$.  The R/S statistic $R(t_i, n)/S(t_i, n)$
(equation \ref{hurst-effect}) is then computed for the starting
points $t_i$ of the $K$ disjoint subsets and for values of $n$
satisfying the relationship $(t_i - 1) + n \leq N$.

\end{center}
\caption{{\bf Pox plots:} Pox plots for (a) Sprite file open events
and (b) NFS file open (W) events are illustrated, and linear curve
fits displayed.}\label{poxplots}
\end{figure}

From equation \ref{hurst-effect} can be derived:
\begin{equation}
\log\left( \frac{R(t_i, n)}{S(t_i, n)}\right) = c_2 + H\log(n).
\end{equation}
Plotting $\log\left(R(t_i, n)/S(t_i, n)\right)$ versus
$\log(n)$ should therefore result in a roughly linear graph with a
slope equal to the Hurst parameter $H$; such a graph is known as a
{\it Pox plot}.

Figure \ref{poxplots} contains Pox plots for the same Sprite file open
and NFS file open (W) events as were used to produce the variance-time
plots of figure \ref{varplots}.  A least-squares linear fit of the
data produced estimated Hurst parameter values of 0.890 and 0.747,
respectively.  These estimates are extremely close to the previously
estimated values of 0.874 and 0.749, which gives confidence to
the variance and Pox plot analysis techniques as well as to the
estimated values of $H$.

Estimates of $H$ were generated through R/S analysis for all of the
available file system events.  Table \ref{var_summary} summarizes the
results of this analysis.  Once again, all estimated Hurst parameters are
well above 0.5, confirming the presence of self-similarity in the file
system traces.  Furthermore, the correlation between all Pox plot generated
$H$ estimates and the previously presented variance-time plot generate $H$
estimates is extremely high, although the estimates' confidence intervals
do not overlap.  With the exception of NFS attribute (W) events, all Pox
plot and variance-time plot estimates were between 5-10\% percent of each
other.

The difference between the two measured H estimates for NFS attribute
(W) events is startling, and cannot be easily explained.  The
uncharacteristically high value of the variance-time plot estimate
(0.9934) suggests the possibility of an error in either the attribute
(W) event traces, or perhaps is a result of the anomalies introduced
during the NFS trace post-processing stage.

To summarize, we have used both variance-time and R/S analysis to
convincingly show that short-term file system traffic exhibits
self-similarity.  The variance-time and R/S analysis produced consistent
measures of the degree of burstiness of the two traces, and these measures
appeared to be closely correlated across the Sprite and NFS traces.

Two characteristics of the Sprite and NFS variance-time plots are
noteworthy - first, both are extremely linear, and have Hurst
parameters of 0.874 and 0.749, respectively, which verifies
the self-similar nature of the processes.  Secondly, the NFS plot
noticeably tapers away from the best-fit line for small values of
$\log(m)$.  There are two factors that contribute to this divergence.

The file open and close events within the NFS traces were
heuristically added during the postprocessing.  The placement of these
events could potentially be inaccurate on an order of hundreds of
milliseconds or even a small number of seconds.  For low values of the
aggregation parameter $m$, the reported events per unit time in the
trace thus contain errors.  However, since the time unit increases
with the aggregation parameter, the contribution of the errors falls
as the level of aggregation gets larger.  A second source of error is
the noticeable discretization for low time units.  As previously
mentioned, this means that the process is really asymptotically
self-similar, and variance plots therefore should become linear in the
limit of large $m$.

In summary, variance-time analysis has revealed that:

\begin{itemize}
\item short-term file system traffic is self-similar in nature.
\item the Hurst parameters (a measure of burstiness) measured from the 
      NFS and the Sprite traces are closely correlated (but not in a
      statistically significant manner), suggesting the
      possibility that this parameter is to some degree independent of the
      type of file system measured.

\begin{itemize}
\item R/S analysis of short-term file system traffic has 
      confirmed that this traffic is self-similar.
\item R/S analysis and variance-time analysis have produced consistent
      measures of the degree of burstiness of the two traces.
\item there is once again a noticeable correlation between the Hurst
      parameters produced for the NFS and Sprite traces via R/S analysis,

\end{itemize}

We have convincingly shown that short-term file system traffic exhibits
self-similarity.  Self-similarity by definition spans all time scales, so
file system traffic over a longer period should exhibit similar behaviour.
The next section of the paper repeats this sections' analysis for a set of
long-term file system traces.
