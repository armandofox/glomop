We would like to thank Mike Dahlin for giving us access to and help with
the Sprite and Auspex file system traces.  We also gratefully acknowledge
the suggestion to investigate ON/OFF behaviour provided by Venkat
Padmanabhan, and the helpful comments of Jeanna Neefe and Eric Anderson.

Padmanabhan, and the helpful comments of Jeanna Neefe.  Drew Roselli
deserves special acknowledgement for tirelessly helping us with the
analysis of her INS cluster traces, as well as providing many useful
insights into their interpretation.  Thanks, Drew!
