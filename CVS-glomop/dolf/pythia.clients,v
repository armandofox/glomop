# Pythia clients file
#
# Each line consists of the following:
# Headername regexp attr1=value1 attr2=value2 .... attrN=valueN
#
# Headername is the HTTP header Pythia should use to identify the
#       client.  In most cases this will be User-Agent, but it can be
#       any HTTP header.
# regexp is the Perl-style regexp to match in that header (no spaces; use
#       the \s escapes instead).  
# Matching of regexp will be case-insensitive.  Matching of header
# requires the header to be in canonical form, i.e. the first letter and
# every letter following a hyphen must be capitalized.
# Note that matches will be tried in the order specified in this file,
# so put the most specific ones first. The last entry should be a
# "default" client to be used in case no match can be made against a
# more specific client.
#
# attr=value are sets of attributes for the client. The following
# attributes are currently recognized. NOTE that these are hints only;
# adherence to restrictions like "keep images below N bytes" are the
# responsibility of the distillation decision function (see the services
# manpage).
#
#  g=0 or g=1: 1 means client is grayscale only
#  c=N: client supports a log2(N)-bit palette (see below for fixed-palette)
#  p=rrggbbrrggbb....  client supports only the fixed color palette
#       given by the rrggbb triplets (rrggbb must be hex digits).
#       Supersedes  "c=N".
#  x=N,y=M: client's viewable display area for browser is NxM pixels
#  i=N: try to avoid sending inline images larger than N bytes
#  h=N: try to avoid sending HTML larger than N bytes
#  b=N: expected bandwidth in BITS per second, in the absence of more
#       specific information from monitoring function
#
