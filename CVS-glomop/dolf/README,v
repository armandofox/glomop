WHAT YOU NEED TO HAVE INSTALLED

Requirements for running the basic Pythia with standalone external
image distillation using NetPBM:  
  
- Perl 5.002 or later installed, including the Socket and POSIX 
  modules (part of the standard distribution).  You can find the latest
  Perl at various FTP archives including ftp.uu.net,
  archive.cis.ohio-state.edu, jpl-devvax.jpl.nasa.gov; or on the Web,
  try http://www.metronet.com/perlinfo/source.

- The MD5 and LWP Perl modules:
	ftp://ftp.metronet.com/pub/perl/modules/by-module/MD5-*.tar.gz
	ftp://ftp.metronet.com/pub/perl/modules/by-module/lwp-*.tar.gz
  These must be installed as normal Perl modules ("make install"
  should do it for most people).

- The NetPBM header files and libraries.  These are needed for image
  distillation.
   You'll find the latest release of Netpbm at the following sites:
   * wuarchive.wustl.edu (128.252.135.4),
     directory /graphics/graphics/packages/NetPBM
   * ikaros.fysik4.kth.se (130.237.35.2), directory /pub/netpbm.
   * ftp.informatik.uni-oldenburg.de (134.106.1.9). This site also carries
     binaries for the Amiga.
   * peipa.essex.ac.uk (155.245.115.161), directory ipa/src/manip
   * ftp.rahul.net (192.160.13.1), directory /pub/davidsen/source
   * ftp.cs.ubc.ca, directory /ftp/archive/netpbm

- For inline JPEG distillation, you need cjpeg and djpeg.  These are available
  from the Independent JPEG Group.

HOW TO INSTALL

1. In the pythia/ subdirectory, say `./configure'.
   ** NOTE ** If your netpbm header files and libraries are NOT in a
   ** standard place, i.e. if you normally would have to supply -I and
   ** -L flags to find them, you should give configure the command line
   ** option:  --with-netpbm=DIR  where DIR/include and DIR/lib contain
   ** the header and library files, respectively.  If the header and
   ** libraries are not in subdirectories of the same directory, you can
   ** also say --with-netpbm-inc=INCLUDEDIR --with-netpbm-lib=LIBDIR to
   ** set them separately.

2. Still in the pythia/ subdirectory, say `gmake install'.  (Things are
   only installed at or below *this* level.)

3. To start: "gmake run PORT=portnum" where portnum is a TCP port of
  your choice on which Pythia will listen.  Pythia has many runtime
  options that you can set with the ARGS makefile variable; say "make
  run ARGS=-h" to see the possible options.

4. After pythia is running, you can start additional distillers
  (e.g. gifmunch) on other machines, by typing:
  
        gifmunch <listenport> <pythia-host> <pythia-port>
  
   <listenport> should be a random port number on the machine on which
      gifmunch will run; it will listen for requests on this port.
   <pythia-host> is the machine on which pythia is running, and
   <pythia-port> is the port on which pythia is listening (the one you
       specify on the pythia command line).

   (Note that the `install' target will install distiller binaries
   in the proxy_bin subdirectory by default.)

7. pythia.users is the user database.  If you delete it, current users
  will have to re-register and their prefs will be forgotten, but
  everything will still work.

TO USE PYTHIA:

Set your HTTP proxy to point to the correct machine and port.  Go to
the URL  "http://PythiaLogin" to start a session.  Use the URL
"http://PythiaPrefs" to change your prefs (you should probably
bookmark these two "magic" URLs).
