@Here is how I understand your proposal:

You adopt a particular naming convention for DOs, such that 

     name-auth-name/work-name

say, is the name of the work.  If I ask for a URL of the form, say.

    http://don't-know-what-host-you-propose/hdl:/name-auth-name/work-name

or maybe just

    http://name-auth-name/work-name

(It would be good if one could just do a 

    hdl://name-auth-name/work-name

and have this go to the proxy server, but I don't think this is possible with 
the common clients.)

your proxy intercepts this, and conjurs up a meta-object.  (You call this a 
fixation of the "elemental DO", but I would prefer to say that this IS the DO. 
 It's a kind of meta-object that in effect expresses in some mark-up language 
what fixations, etc. are available.  That is changes over time just means that 
it is modifiable DO.)  For this to work right, you should issue another handle 
from this http interaction, the result of which is also intercepted by the 
proxy.  The interaction is to return the DO from a repository.  In your  case, 
the repository is virtual:  You create some DOs by computation.

(You might want to consider returning disseminations, i.e., a package that 
encapulates the DO, although the user need never see this.)

Actually, it might be nice to include in your URL/handle syntax something like 
this

     name-auth-name/fgv1/work-name

i.e., something that tells the proxy that this is a conforming Fox-Gribble 
handle.

It would be interesting to think about this in the context of PURLs, 
http://purl.oclc.org/, which is an attempt to provide persistant URLs.  The 
purposes are different but the applications overlap.

So, yeah, I think there is a project in there somewhere....
