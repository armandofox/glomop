1.1
log
@Added serial.pl to configure serial port - still needs work.  Changed
return string of AUTH_OK msg to make it distinct from all other msgs. New
rule: msgs must have initial strings that are unique in first 2 letters
(case insensitive).  Minor changes to msgdefs.pl and the lang_*.pl to allow
passing of constant arg strings for code generation.  Added a "newt" client.
