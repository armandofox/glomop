@Added serial.pl to configure serial port - still needs work.  Changed
return string of AUTH_OK msg to make it distinct from all other msgs. New
rule: msgs must have initial strings that are unique in first 2 letters
(case insensitive).  Minor changes to msgdefs.pl and the lang_*.pl to allow
passing of constant arg strings for code generation.  Added a "newt" client.

@Did a complete merge with the source tree from Wink, and got refinement and
Kerberos authentication working again.  Many, many little subtle changes.
The refinement path was changed to "./gmtmpXXX/I1" from an absolute path
name, which broke some regexps.  Fixing that helped, as well as calling
the determine_htype function with a filename instead of undef.

@segmgr renamed to chunk.  lots of changes including new html parser,
rudimentary layout manager, beginnings of interface to ptm, modularized
front-end vs back-end distiller components (but interfaces aren't really
stabilized yet).

1.1
log
@no longer a need for http transport mgr; using LWP perl module.
completed multilanguage support for msgdef generation.  added messages
for doc open and chunk xmission to hsk.txt.  added monitor calls for
showing open documents.  modified testdrv to use as generic send/receive
of any messags defined in hsk.txt.  began working on doc.pl document
abstraction.
