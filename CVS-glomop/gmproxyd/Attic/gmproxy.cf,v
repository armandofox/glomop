1.3
log
@prefs stuff more robust; falls back on defaults, read from .prefs file
in each htype module. prefs sort-of-observed
for target size in bytes (actually for latency, calculated backwards
from network bandwidth), but ignores all others prefs right
now. standalone gifmunch is used to do distillation.  network.pl will
be where NCM calls get made; right now it returns static values.  also
change to startup rendezvous for monitor; proxy PID is now attached to
rendezvous file name, and passed as first (and only) arg to gmmon.

1.2
log
@Added utilities file (with debugging stuff and generalization of
instance-variable access for various classes), and segment manager
(provides generic segmentation services).  'tm' submodule will contain
high-level document type (htype) "chunkers".  added close_doc message to
hsk.txt.

1.1
log
@moved some globals into config file.  first cut at mainloop.  created
directories for front-end servers, transport managers, and doc type
segmenters.  split out message-parsing-code generation so that various
language back-ends can be used, allowing message code to be generated
automatically for clients in different languages; say 'perl5 msgdefs.pl
<lang>' to do it.
