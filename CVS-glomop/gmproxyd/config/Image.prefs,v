1.2
log
@Did a complete merge with the source tree from Wink, and got refinement and
Kerberos authentication working again.  Many, many little subtle changes.
The refinement path was changed to "./gmtmpXXX/I1" from an absolute path
name, which broke some regexps.  Fixing that helped, as well as calling
the determine_htype function with a filename instead of undef.
