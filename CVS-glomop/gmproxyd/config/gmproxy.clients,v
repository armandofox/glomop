1.3
log
@Added serial.pl to configure serial port - still needs work.  Changed
return string of AUTH_OK msg to make it distinct from all other msgs. New
rule: msgs must have initial strings that are unique in first 2 letters
(case insensitive).  Minor changes to msgdefs.pl and the lang_*.pl to allow
passing of constant arg strings for code generation.  Added a "newt" client.

1.2
log
@Did a complete merge with the source tree from Wink, and got refinement and
Kerberos authentication working again.  Many, many little subtle changes.
The refinement path was changed to "./gmtmpXXX/I1" from an absolute path
name, which broke some regexps.  Fixing that helped, as well as calling
the determine_htype function with a filename instead of undef.
