@Did a complete merge with the source tree from Wink, and got refinement and
Kerberos authentication working again.  Many, many little subtle changes.
The refinement path was changed to "./gmtmpXXX/I1" from an absolute path
name, which broke some regexps.  Fixing that helped, as well as calling
the determine_htype function with a filename instead of undef.

# network.pl - interface to NCM

=head1 NAME

network - Network Connection Monitor and Proxy Transcoder Manager interface

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 require "network.pl";

=head1 DESCRIPTION

These functions provide an interface to the data delivered by the Network
Connection Monitor and Proxy Transcoder Manager.  They are still under
construction.

=head1 NCM INTERFACE

Except as noted, all properties of interest from the NCM return a second
argument, the confidence level between 0.0 and 1.0, if called in an array
context.

=over 3

=item $bw = &network::bandwidth;

=item ($bw,$conf) = &network::bandwidth;

=item $lat = &network::latency;

=item ($lat,$conf) = &network::latency;

Return the current bandwidth and latency, respectively, optionally with their
confidences. 

=back

=head1 PTM INTERFACE

Still under construction.

=cut

package network;

#
#  Return various quantities of interest, each with a 95% confidence interval
#

# bandwidth in bits/s
sub bandwidth { wantarray? (28800,1.0) : 28800 }

# one-way latency in ms
sub latency { wantarray? (1000,1.0) : 1000 }

@segmgr renamed to chunk.  lots of changes including new html parser,
rudimentary layout manager, beginnings of interface to ptm, modularized
front-end vs back-end distiller components (but interfaces aren't really
stabilized yet).
