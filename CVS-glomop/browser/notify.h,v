@o Added a horizontal scrollbar
o Added panning when you drag on the main form (as long as your penDown wasn't
  on something interesting); if we want to do "select text" later, something
  will have to be done.

1.3
log
@o When loading a page with the Open form, the yoffset would incorrectly
  be set to 0 (top) when the request was _sent_.  This caused a ghost
  image to appear, overlaid on the real one.  Fixed.
o If a download was canceled in the middle, and then you "Open" a URL in
  your cache, the partway-done status bar would remain on the screen.  Fixed.
