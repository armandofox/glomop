/* Interface to ocr_ps.c, which is close to a line-by-line translation
   of OCR_PS.m3, developed as part of the Virtual Paper project at the
   Systems Research Center.  The main differences are that there is a
   single global instance rather than an object type, and the output
   is delivered as a sequence of words separated by space or newline
   as appropriate to reconstruct the original line structure. */
