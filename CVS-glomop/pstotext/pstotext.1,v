.SH "DESCRIPTION"
\fBpstotext\fR reads one or more PostScript files, and writes to
standard output a representation of the plain text that would be
displayed if the PostScript file were printed.  As is described in the
DETAILS section below, this representation is only an approximation.
Nevertheless, it is often useful for information retrieval (e.g.,
running grep(1) or building a full\-text index) or to recover the text
from a PostScript file whose source you have lost.
.PP
\fBpstotext\fR calls Ghostscript, which must be invokable on the current
search path as gs.
.PP
\fBpstotext\fR reads and processes the command line from left to right,
ignoring the case of options.  When it encounters a path, it opens the
file and expects to find a PostScript job to process.  The option \-
means to read and process a PostScript job from standard input.  If no
\- or path arguments are encountered, \fBpstotext\fR reads from standard
input.
.PP
The options \-landscape and \-landscapeOther should be used for
PostScript jobs that must be rotated 90 degrees clockwise or
counterclockwise, respectively, in order to be readable.
.SH "DETAILS"
\fBpstotext\fR does its work by making Ghostscript load a PostScript
library that causes it to write to standard output information about
each string rendered by a PostScript job.  This information includes
the characters of the string, and enough additional information to
approximate the string's bounding rectangle.  \fBpstotext\fR
post\-processes this information and outputs a sequence of words
delimited by space, newline, and formfeed.
.PP
\fBpstotext\fR outputs words in the same sequence as they are rendered
by the PostScript job.  This usually, but not always, follows the
order that a human would read the words on a page.  Within this
sequence, words are separated by either space or newline depending on
whether or not they fall on the same line.  Each page is terminated
with a formfeed.  If you use the incorrect option from the set
{\-portrait, \-landscape, \-landscapeOther}, \fBpstotext\fR is likely to
substitute newline for space.
.PP
A PostScript job often renders one word as several strings in order to
get correct spacing between particular pairs of characters.
\fBpstotext\fR does its best to assemble these strings back into words,
using a simple heuristic: strings separated by a distance of less than
0.3 times the minimum of the average character widths in the two
strings are considered to be part of the same word.  Note that this
typically causes leading and trailing punctuation characters to be
included with a word.
.PP
The PostScript language provides a flexible encoding scheme by which
character codes in strings select specific characters (symbols), so a
PostScript job is free to use any character code.  On the other hand,
\fBpstotext\fR always translates to the ISO 8859\-1 (Latin\-1) character
code, which is an extension to ASCII covering most of the European
languages.  When a character isn't present in ISO 8859\-1,
\fBpstotext\fR uses a sequence of characters, e.g., "\-\-\-" for em dash.
\fBpstotext\fR can be fooled by font whose Encoding vector doesn't
follow Adobe's conventions, but it contains heuristics allowing it to
handle a wide variety of misbehaving fonts.
.PP
\fBpstotext\fR always translates hyphen (ISO 8859\-1 \\255) to minus
(\\055).
