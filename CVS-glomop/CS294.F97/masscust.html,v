<title>Mass Customization</title>
</head>

<body>
<h2>Why track per-user state?</h2>

<ul>
  <li> basis of ad targeting (up to 10x revenue)
  <li> basis of content customization
  <li> track behavior of users over time ("virtual focus group" - has
       advantage of large sample size, truly random selection,
       users who don't know they're participating in it)
</ul>

<h2>How to do it</h2>

<ul>
  <li> URL munging and/or HTTP redirect; but need to magify embedded
       links/URL's as well ("fat URL")
       <ul>
         <li> interaction w/caching?
       </ul>
  <li> cookies
  <li> ip address/login
  <li> pass around state itself vs. handle to state
  <li> why has server-side state won, despite being more expensive to
       implement? 
       <ul>
         <li>  No schema changes
         <li> Enable analysis
       </ul>
</ul>

<h2>Weak vs strong identity</h2>

<ul>
  <li> Tracking weak identities to try to tie to strong identity
       <ul>
         <li> Watch "Referer" for URL's with embedded usernames
         <li> ISP's and caches see all your traffic, incl. hits to sites with
              embedded usernames
         <li> People often do searches for themselves
         <li> Doubleclick.com: your weak-id info is tracked by a third party,
              across many partner sites, usu. without telling you.
       </ul>
  <li> Therefore one site's guarantee of anonymity for your strong ID
       info is probably not as useful as you think.
</ul>

<h2>Content customization</h2>

<ul>
  <li> Dynamic HTML using Tcl macros
  <li> Microsoft ASP
</ul>

<h2>Stuff to think about</h2>

<ul>
  <li> Problems with IP-address-based identification when using proxy
  <li> "Login": what if client supported it directly?  what if proxy
       supported it based on  ????
  <li> Ad click-thru vs. caching (eg Doubleclick)
  <li> What will happen to ad-supported sites if aggregation agents
       become widespread? (e.g. totalnews.com)
</ul>
