This is the binary distribution of the TranSend transformational HTTP
proxy.

You need the following support:

1. Kernel support for Multicast 
   You must have an ethernet card
2. libpthreads support
   you can get libpthreads from ftp://tsx-11.mit.edu
3. TCL/TK 7.5 or greater
4. X11 library files
5. PERL 5.004_01 with LWP installed (libwww for perl), and all of the
   modules that LWP depends on must also be installed.  Currently, this
   includes Data-Dumper, IO, MD5, , MIME-Base64, libnet, and Socket.
   PERL 5.004_01 needs to have libperl.so (not libperl.a) installed
   in the CORE directory

I. What is tcsproxy?

Tcsproxy ("the Berkeley Smart Proxy") is a cluster based, scalable
platform for running interactive Internet applications, particularly
those that use the proxy model.  Common examples today include
anonymization, compression/filtering, content collation/aggregation,
data format transformation, etc.

The binary distribution comes "out of the box" ready to run the Berkeley
TranSend application, which speeds up web browsing by a factor of 3 to 7
through lossy compression of inline images.  To use TranSend, once the
cluster service is running, users simply select the TranSend host and
port as their HTTP proxy (in the configuration dialogs for their Web
browsers).

Other applications, and complete documentation for writing your own,
are being made available on an ongoing basis; see the FAQ for details
(URL at end of this document).  One application that will be available
Real Soon Now is the Wingman service, which enables graphical Web
access from the PalmPilot Professional PDA using our client-side
software Top Gun Wingman (http://www.isaac.cs.berkeley.edu/pilot/wingman).

At UC Berkeley, we have found that a cluster of four Sparcstation-10's,
or a single Ultra-1 167Mhz, supports the entire dialup IP population.
This population consists primarily of a bank of 700 modems (some 14.4,
mostly 28.8) connected to the campus network via a single 10 Mbit shared
Ethernet segment, which is rarely observed to saturate.  The peak load
observed from this population has been about 15 hits per second at the
proxy; average load is less than 1/2 this amount.

Various refereed papers about the Berkeley Smart Proxy project can be
found at http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~fox/glomop/.


II. Configuration.

   1. gm_options file.

   Copy gm_options to gm_options.<your username> and edit the following values 
   in the copy:

   proxy.home 
   proxy.perlmod
   frontend.* (most specifically: frontend.http_listen_port)
   cache.Partition
   ptm.multicast
   Monitor.listen

   2. Caches

   Inside the harvest/lib directory, edit the cached.conf file. 
   Modify only the following entries, and only if necessary:

   local_domain
   cache_mem
   cache_swap
   cache_dir
   cache_access_log
   cache_hierarchy_log
   cache_log
   connect_timeout
   dns_children
   cache_mgr
   cache_effective_user

   Then, go into harvest/bin and modify RunCache and RunCache.flush so
   that HARVEST_HOME points to the 'harvest' directory (i.e. the
   directory that contains bin and lib).
 
III. Start up.
  
    1. To start the base system say:
       gmake run_base_system
       This starts the fe_check.pl which will start up the frontend.

    2. To just start the monitor say: 
       gmake run_monitor
       The monitor panel should appear on your display somewhere.

    3. To just start the frontend say:
       gmake run_frontend
       The front end's status bar should be added to the monitor panel.

    4. To just start the PTM say:
       gmake run_ptm
       The PTM's status bar should be added to the monitor panel.
   
    5. To just start the caches say:
       gmake run_caches

At this point the front end should be running, and you should be able to
connect to it as an HTTP proxy on the port specified in the gm_options file
under frontend.http_listen_port.

NOTE:
 - each frontend maintains an internal list of caches that it knows
   about, as specified in the gm_options file.  If a cache goes down,
   the frontend permanently strikes that cache off of it's list of known
   caches.  Send the frontend process a SIGHUP (kill -HUP <pid>) in
   order to tell it to rebuild it's list of known caches from the
   gm_options file, and **MAKE SURE** to do it whenever a cache crashes
   and then comes back up.


IV. What now?


V. Bugs

1. Frontend
2. PTM
3. Caches

  - The harvest cache incorrectly caches web pages that have cookies
    associated with them, which can cause cookied sites to break.
  - The harvest caches' fault tolerance should be integrated into the
    PTM - the frontend SIGHUP mechanism is a bad hack.

4. Monitor
5. Other
