README for SGML Lexical Analyzer Code

$Id: README,v 1.1.1.1 1996/10/25 02:37:15 fox Exp $

This stuff has been tested on Linux 1.2.13 with gcc 2.7.0,
but it's supposed to be straight ANSI C, so it should build
on anything. Just type make. Actually, make test will let
you know if it's basically working.

Have a look at the tech report in sgml-lex.html, then look
at sgml_lex.h for the API details, and if you're really
curious, sgml.l for the lexical details.
