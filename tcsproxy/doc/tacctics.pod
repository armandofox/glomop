=item Use the Monitor

Use the MonitorClient_Send function to send verbose output to the
Monitor window.  The Monitor is actually completely extensible in that
you can define your own graphical reporting behaviors on the fly;
additional Monitor documentation is forthcoming.

Open the windows for the other entities reported by the Monitor and see
what they have to say.  Was the PTM unable to launch a distiller? Is the
Front End in pain?  etc.

=item Use the test harness

The test harness is a reasonable sanity check: if your filter doesn't
work with it, it's not likely to work on its own.

=item Use Perl

Filters in C/C++ are a bear to debug, although you can certainly use
I<gdb> and set appropriate breakpoints.  Caveat programmer.
