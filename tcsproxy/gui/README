Using the monitor code
----------------------

The reporting application must be linked against libmon.{a,so}.  The
comments in mon.h indicate how to use the functions.

The monitor itself is Tcl/Tk with a simple dynamically-loaded extension
(tudp.so) which is a Makefile target.  It can listen on either a unicast
or multicast UDP socket for information from various reporting agents.
This will soon be upgraded to use the tcl-level socket facilities.

The configure script that generates Makefile from Makefile.in is one
level above this directory.  Do a 'cvs update -l' at that level to get
it.

If you want to add new modules (behaviors) to the monitor, you can
create a file called <foo>_procs.tcl.  All such files are automatically
sourced at startup.

Many enhancements are needed but they will wait till after SOSP.  :)
